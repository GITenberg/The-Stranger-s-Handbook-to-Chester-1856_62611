<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Rare</span> old city of <span
class="smcap">Chester</span>!&rdquo; writes Albert Smith in his
&ldquo;Struggles and Adventures of Christopher
Tadpole,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rare old city of Chester!&nbsp; Even
in these days of rocket-like travelling, a man might fly all over
Great Britain and Ireland, with an extra &lsquo;day ticket&rsquo;
for Berwick-upon-Tweed, before he saw anything half so fine as
the mouldering old walls and towers of that venerable city, or
looked upon anything half so fair as the prospect of vale and
mountain, wooded headland, and spire-pointed plain, that
surrounds it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Well said, friend
Albert;&mdash;echoed, too, far and wide, by the thousands of
visitors who are annually led to seek entertainment within its
Walls!</p>
<p>Situate on the northern banks of the River Dee, the deified
stream of the Ancient Britons,&mdash;built upon, or, as we ought
rather to say, built <i>into</i> the solid rock, for the
principal streets within the Walls are almost wholly excavations
of several feet in depth&mdash;the city of Chester stands forth
before the world certainly the most curious city in the British
Isles, second to none of its fellows in martial strength or
historic importance, and as a faithful and enduring relic of the
past, &ldquo;peerless and alone!&rdquo;</p>
<p>First a settlement of the Ancient Britons&mdash;then a colony
of <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>imperial
Rome&mdash;afterwards a favourite city and frequent resort of the
Anglo-Saxon monarchs&mdash;now the camp and court of Hugh Lupus
the Norman, nephew of the Conqueror&mdash;then the key to the
subjugation of Wales, and to its union with the English
crown&mdash;ever a city of loyalty and renown,&mdash;no admirer
of the curious and remarkable, none who seek after the ancient
and honourable, should fail to visit and explore the beauties of
&ldquo;rare old Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eye of the stranger, be
he Englishman or foreigner, European or American, will here find
an ample and luxuriant field for admiration: the man of taste,
who may linger within its Walls, will not depart ungratified; nor
will the antiquary search here in vain for some rich and
profitable treasures of investigation: in short, such is the
antiquity, the peculiarity of Chester, that the stranger who can
pass through without bestowing on it some little share of
attention, must have a dull and incurious eye indeed.</p>
<p>Before we proceed to point out to the visitor the numerous
objects of interest within the city, we must conform to the
fashion prevalent in such matters, and, tedious though it may
seem, preface our description with a condensed sketch of the</p>
<h3>HISTORY OF CHESTER,</h3>
<p>Some historians there are who, dealing largely in the
marvellous, have attributed to Chester an existence almost coeval
with the Flood.&nbsp; Sir Thomas Elyot, for instance, writing
about 1520, gravely asserts that the name of the city was
originally Neomagus, and so called from its founder Magus, the
grandson of Japhet, the son of Noah, who first planted
inhabitants in these islands!&nbsp; Were this statement
authenticated, Chester would hold the dignified position of the
oldest city in the universe; but, credulous as we undoubtedly are
on some points, we confess to a modicum of infidelity upon
this.&nbsp; It may have been, and from its commanding position
doubtless was, one of the earliest settlements of the aboriginal
inhabitants, Ancient Britons or otherwise; but farther than this,
no historian, desiring to be accurate, can safely go.</p>
<p>Ranulph Higden, a shorn monk of Chester Abbey, attributes to
the city a British foundation, namely, from Lleon Gawr, the
vanquisher of the Picts, a giant of mammoth size and stature, who
built a city here, chiefly <i>underground</i>, hewn out of the
rock, and after a rude and disordered fashion.&nbsp; But let the
&ldquo;barefooted friar&rdquo; speak for himself, from Wynkyn de
Worde&rsquo;s edition of his Chronicle, published <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1495:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>&ldquo;The Cyte of Legyons, that is Chestre, in the
marches of Englonde, towarde Wales, betwegne two armes of the
see, that bee named <i>Dee</i> and <i>Mersee</i>.&nbsp; Thys cyte
in tyme of Britons, was hede and chyefe cyte of all Venedocia,
that is, North Wales.&nbsp; Thys cyte in Brytyshe speche bete
Carthleon, Chestre in Englyshe, and Cyte of Legyons also.&nbsp;
For there laye a wynter the legyons that Julius Cezar sent for to
wyne Irlonde.&nbsp; And after, Claudius Cezar sent legyons out of
the cyte for to wynn the Islands that be called Orcades.&nbsp;
Thys cyte hath plente of lyveland, of corn, of fleshe, and
specyally of samon.&nbsp; Thys cyte receyveth grate marchandyse,
and sendeth out also.&nbsp; Northumbres destroyed thys cyte
sometyme, but Elfreda, lady of Mercia, bylded it agayn, and made
it mouch more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In thys cyte ben ways under erth, with vowtes and stone
werke, wonderfully wrought, three chambred werkes, grete stones
ingrave with old mannes names there in.&nbsp; Thys is that cyte
that Ethelfrede, Kyng of Northumberlonde, destroyed, and sloughe
there fast by nygh two thousonde monks of the mynster of
Bangor.&nbsp; Thys is the cyte that Kyng Edgar cam to, some tyme,
with seven Kyngs that were subject to hym.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The delectable style of building above described is also thus
commented upon in that poetical curiosity, the &ldquo;Lyfe of St.
Werburgh,&rdquo; by Henry Bradshaw, another monk of Chester
Abbey, who flourished in sackcloth and ashes sometime previous to
1500:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The founder of Chester, as saith Polychronicon,<br
/>
Was Leon Gauer, a mighty strong giant;<br />
Which builded caves and dungeons many a one,<br />
No goodly buildings, ne proper, ne pleasant.<br />
But King Leil, a Briton sure and valiant,<br />
Was founder of Chester by pleasant building,<br />
And of Caerleil also named by the King.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Among the ancient Britons, the city was known from time
immemorial as Caerlleon Vawr, and Caerlleon ar Dyfyrdwy, and was
certainly with them a city of great importance, long before the
advent of the Roman invaders to these shores.&nbsp; Equally
certain is it that our primitive forefathers, unable to stem the
onward current of the victorious Romans, fled in disorder from
the city of Caerlleon (Chester), to the mountain fastnesses of
Wales, and there concentrating themselves, defied for many a long
and eventful century alike the wiles and encroachments of their
enemies.</p>
<p>Chester, resigned to the tender mercies of the conquerors,
rapidly lost its first estate;&mdash;rising again, however, under
the <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>shade of
the imperial eagles, like a ph&oelig;nix from its ashes, to be
the chosen camp and colony of the Twentieth Legion of
C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; Stirring times were these for old Chester; the
rude huts of the Britons, the temples and altars of the ancient
Druids, the mud walls and other defences of her former
possessors, all vanished like a dream, while in their place arose
the proud Pr&aelig;torium, the pagan temples, the stately
columns, the peerless masonry, the noble statues, the massive
Walls, and all the other elements of civilisation which usually
followed in the wake of proud old Rome!&nbsp; Perhaps of the many
Roman settlements in Britain, none have retained to our own time
so many enduring proofs of their energetic rule as Chester.&nbsp;
Surrounded by Walls, which for almost their entire length rest
upon Roman foundations,&mdash;nay, which still exhibit to the
naked eye of truth and time the evident impress of their
mechanical genius,&mdash;we fancy, while we look thereon, that we
see the sturdy warriors pacing to and fro, keeping watch against
the enemy; while, within the city, the soldiers and inhabitants
are plying the pickaxe, trowel, and spade,&mdash;here piling
stone upon stone in the erection of a forum, and there planning
and building the tesselated floors, the baths, and the sudatories
of domestic life.&nbsp; Eighteen hundred years have rolled away
since Julius Agricola and his Legion held sway over the city, and
yet ever since then, notwithstanding that <i>they</i> have long
lain in the dust, scarce a year has passed without the
encroachments of the builder, or the researches of the antiquary,
bringing to light some long hidden, but valuable relic of this
extraordinary people.&nbsp; Time and space alike forbid us to
give anything like a summary of the records existing, under our
very eyes, of Rome&rsquo;s sojourn within these walls.&nbsp;
Other and more antiquated guide-books have long ago exhausted and
worn out these topics of interest, as well as the miserable
woodcuts that illustrated them; it only remains therefore for us,
in the body of our work, to enumerate a few of the more prominent
and accessible of these remains.</p>
<p>But another epoch was now rapidly dawning upon the
world.&nbsp; Rome had passed the meridian of her splendour, and
she who, so short a time before, was acknowledged mistress of the
world, felt the tide of conquest and prosperity visibly ebbing
away.&nbsp; Insurrections abroad, divisions, tumults, and murders
at home, served but to aggravate and complete her fall.&nbsp;
After the departure of the Romans from this island, Chester
appears to have been alternately possessed by the Britons, the
Saxons, and the Danes; by the latter, however, it was held but a
very short period, being <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>restored to the Saxons by the valiant
daughter of Alfred the Great, Ethelfleda, the wife of Ethelred,
Prince of Mercia.&nbsp; This lady is said to have repaired the
city and rebuilt the walls in 907, and, as some affirm,
considerably added to their former extent.&nbsp; After her death,
the city again fell into the hands of the British princes, from
whom it was recovered in 924 by King Egbert, whose death almost
immediately followed this event.&nbsp; National affairs were then
conducted according to that</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;good
old-fashioned plan,<br />
That they shall take who have the power,<br />
And they shall keep who can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From this period to the Conquest, Chester has nothing of a
tale to tell; but on the accession of William the Conqueror, he
created his nephew Hugh Lupus, Earl of Chester, at the same time
investing him with supreme authority throughout the county and
city, so that he held as absolute a regal sway within those
limits as the king himself had in his dominions.&nbsp; For one
hundred and sixty years did Hugh Lupus and his successors, the
seven Norman Earls of Chester, exercise their petty sovereignty
over the city and county, until the death of Earl John Scot, in
1237, when Henry III. took the earldom, with all the powers
annexed to it, into his own hands; and from that period to the
present it has been held by the English Crown.&nbsp; The title of
Earl of Chester was conferred by Henry upon his eldest son,
afterwards Edward I.&nbsp; It has ever since been vested in the
reigning monarch&rsquo;s eldest son, and is now enjoyed by his
Royal Highness, Albert, Prince of Wales, the hopeful heir of our
beloved Queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1255, the Welsh, under their Prince, Llewellyn, made
an irruption into this neighbourhood, carrying fire and sword to
the very gates of the city.&nbsp; The following year Prince
Edward, who had recently been created Earl of Chester, paid a
visit to the city, and received the homage of the nobles of
Cheshire and part of Wales.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hostile inroads of
Llewellyn remained unrevenged until King Henry, in 1257, summoned
his nobility and bishops to attend with their vassals at Chester,
in order to invade the Principality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1272, Edward I. ascended the throne, and soon gave
indications of his determination to subject Wales to the English
crown.&nbsp; This monarch was at Chester in 1276 and 1277; in the
former year he came for the purpose of summoning Llewellyn,
Prince of Wales, to do him homage; who having refused to <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>comply, he
returned the next year with an army, and marching from Chester,
took Rhuddlan castle, and made it a strong fortress.&nbsp; In
1282, we again find Edward I. in the city, where he resided from
the 6th of June to the 4th of July.&nbsp; The following year,
having been victorious in his expedition against the Welsh, he
was at Chester with his Queen, and attended mass in St.
Werburgh&rsquo;s Church, on which occasion he presented the Abbey
with a cloth of great value.&nbsp; In September, 1284, the King
was at Chester for four days, and again passed through the city
in 1294, on his march to Wales, to suppress the rebellion of
Madoc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1312, Edward II. came to Chester to meet Piers de
Gaveston, on his return from Ireland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1399, Henry of Lancaster, in arms against Richard
II., mustered his troops under the Walls of Chester, whence, on
the 19th of August, he marched for Flint, and returned on the
following day with Richard, whom he lodged in a tower over the
outer gateway of the castle, opposite to Glover&rsquo;s Stone,
from whence he was conveyed prisoner to London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1459, Henry VI., with Queen Margaret and her son
Edward, visited Chester, and bestowed little silver swans on the
Cheshire gentlemen who espoused her cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 13th of July, 1494, Henry VII., with his mother
and the Queen, came to Chester with a great retinue, from whence
they proceeded to Hawarden; the Earl of Derby, and a number of
&lsquo;Chester gallants&rsquo; attending.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The summer of the year 1507, was memorable here from
the awful visitation of the &lsquo;sweating sickness,&rsquo;
which raged for a short time with great violence.&nbsp; It is
recorded that 91 householders were carried off in three days by
this distemper; but it is worthy of remark, that the female sex
were generally exempt from the plague, only four having fallen
victims to the disease.&nbsp; Cats and women have each nine
lives!&nbsp; In 1517, the sweating sickness again proved fatal to
many of the inhabitants; and the city was also infected with the
plague, probably to a more serious extent.&nbsp; It is recorded
that &lsquo;many died and others fled out of the city, insomuch
that the streets were full of grass;&rsquo; and &lsquo;that for
want of trading the grass did grow a foot high at the Cross, and
in other streets of the city.&rsquo;&nbsp; In 1550 the city
suffered severely from the sweating sickness, and to this
affliction was added a great scarcity of provisions; corn selling
in Chester at sixteen shillings a bushel.&nbsp; From the year
1602 to 1605, with few intermissions, the dreadful effects of the
plague were experienced in the city.&nbsp; It is stated to <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>have begun in
the month of September, in the former year, at the house of one
Glover, in St. John&rsquo;s lane, in whose house alone seven
persons died.&nbsp; The contagion was particularly fatal in 1603
and 1604; 650 persons died in the former year, and 986 in the
latter; at one period 55 died weekly.&mdash;During this dreadful
visitation, the fairs of the city were suspended, the court of
exchequer was removed to Tarvin, and the county assizes were held
at Nantwich.&nbsp; The plague had abated in the month of February
1605.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this time to 1642 no event of any great importance
appears to have transpired.&nbsp; In the autumn of that year,
however, the Cestrians found themselves embroiled in the civil
war which then broke out in England; and as this was one of the
proudest and most memorable epochs in our city&rsquo;s history, a
condensed sketch of the part she and her sons played therein may
not be uninteresting.</p>
<p>On the 25th of August, 1642, the commons being then in open
rebellion against his majesty, King Charles hoisted his standard
at Nottingham, and proclaimed war between himself and the
parliament.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three weeks after this, the king came to
Chester, accompanied by a numerous train: the incorporated
companies of the city received him and conducted him to the
Pentice, where he and his suite were entertained.&nbsp; After the
banquet, 200<i>l.</i> were presented to his majesty, and half
that sum to the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; On the 28th of September,
the king proceeded to Wrexham, escorted by the corporation to the
city boundary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;War being declared, Chester was deemed a place of great
importance; and his majesty sent hither Sir Nicholas Byron, with
a commission as Colonel-General of Cheshire, and Governor of
Chester.&nbsp; A levy of 300 men was ordered by the citizens,
independent of the trained bands, and a rate was made for their
maintenance.&nbsp; The outworks and entrenchments were carried on
with such vigour, that in the beginning of the summer, 1643, the
<i>mud walls</i>, <i>mounts</i>, <i>bastions</i>, &amp;c. were
all completed, and several effective batteries
planted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon Thursday, the 19th of July, 1643, Sir William Brereton,
general of the parliamentary forces, made an assault upon the
works, but they were so resolutely defended, that he was beaten
off, and forced to retire.&nbsp; On the 11th of November, the
town and castle of Hawarden was surrendered to Sir William
Brereton, who sent a summons to Chester, requiring the surrender
of the city under pain of condign punishment in case of
refusal.&nbsp; Governor <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Byron sent him for answer, that he was
not to be terrified by words, but bade him &ldquo;come and win
the city, if he would have it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The authorities
busied themselves in perfecting the defences of the city: three
troops of horse were raised, for the maintenance of which the
citizens assessed themselves according to their abilities, and
converted 100<i>l.</i> worth of the city plate into coin, some of
which pieces, stamped with the city arms, still exist in the
cabinets of numismatists.</p>
<p>On the 13th of February, 1644, a battle was fought near
Boughton, in which the enemy were forced to retire.&nbsp; About
100 of the royalists, chiefly Chester men, fell in this
engagement.</p>
<p>On the 19th of September, the parliamentary forces from
Beeston Castle advanced to Chester, and immediately transmitted a
peremptory summons.&nbsp; Ere an answer could be returned, the
enemy made a brisk attack upon the city, but were repulsed with
loss: the city walls now constituted the only defence of the
besieged.&nbsp; After various skirmishes on each side, the
besieging commanders opened a correspondence, which, however,
terminated without leading to any result.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the end of February, 1645, the enemy had succeeded
in surrounding the city, and placed garrisons at Hoole, Rowton,
Eccleston, Iron-bridge, Upton, &amp;c.&nbsp; In this position
affairs remained until the middle of September, when the garrison
were gladdened by the news that the king was on his march for the
relief of the city.&nbsp; The exultation of the citizens was
beyond all bounds: but there is reason to believe, that in their
excess of joy, measures of prudence were grievously
neglected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the 27th of September, his majesty, with his guards,
and Lord Gerard, with the remainder of the horse, marched into
the city, amidst the acclamations of the soldiers and
citizens.&nbsp; The condition of the garrison now presented a
promising appearance.&nbsp; Sir Marmaduke Langdale, as previously
arranged, passed the river at Holt, and marching in the direction
of Chester, drew up his forces upon Rowton Heath, about two miles
from the city, where, on the afternoon of the same day, the
decisive battle took place; the parliamentary forces, under
Major-General Poyntz, totally routing the royalists.&nbsp; His
majesty, attended by Sir Francis Gamull, and Alderman Cowper, had
the mortification to witness the rout of his army from the leads
of the Ph&oelig;nix tower.&nbsp; On the following day the royal
fugitive took his departure for Denbigh Castle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the 29th of September, the besiegers effected a breach near
<a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>the Newgate,
and at night made an assault, but were repulsed.&nbsp; On October
7th, the city was surrounded by their horse, and a violent
assault made in several places.&nbsp; For a long time the
conflict was doubtful; at length the assailants, having gained
the top of the Walls, were again beaten off, thrown down, and
killed.&nbsp; From this time the parliamentary commander
despaired of taking the city by assault, and immediately
converted the siege into a close blockade&mdash;a high compliment
to the gallantry of the inhabitants of Chester.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beginning of 1646 found the garrison in want of the
common necessaries of life, being so reduced as to be compelled
to feed upon horses, dogs, and cats.&nbsp; In this extremity the
garrison rejected nine different summonses, nor, till they
received assurances that there was no hope of succour, did they
answer the tenth.&nbsp; The negotiations occupied six days, when
conditions were agreed to&mdash;that the garrison should march
out with the honours of war, and that all the ammunition, stores,
&amp;c. in the castle, be delivered up without injury to the
besieging army.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In conformity with these articles, the brave and loyal
city of Chester, which had held out twenty weeks beyond
expectation, being reduced by famine to the utmost extremity,
was, upon the 3rd of February, 1646, surrendered up to the
parliamentary forces.&nbsp; For two years, nothing had been heard
but the sound of warlike preparations, and during most of that
time the citizens were inclosed within their Walls, the victims
of starvation and constant apprehension.&nbsp; The incessant
drains upon their property for the maintenance of the garrison,
and the support of their fugitive prince, had levelled the
different classes of the community to one common condition of
beggary.&nbsp; The whole suburbs presented an undistinguishable
mass of ruins, while the Walls and edifices within the city were
defaced or battered down by the destructive cannon.&nbsp; In
addition to this, the city lands were all mortgaged, the funds
quite exhausted, the plate melted down, and the churches,
particularly St. John&rsquo;s, being so long in possession of the
enemy, greatly damaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this eventful period down to the present day, saving a
few royal visits, no circumstance has occurred of sufficient
import to deserve especial mention here.&nbsp; So now, kind
reader, having in our own way, and as briefly and modestly as
possible, told our historic tale, we will close the present
chapter, and in our next be ready to accompany you in your
wanderings about the city.</p>

Terminus of Six Railways.&mdash;Flookersbrook.&mdash;Lead
Works.&mdash;Canal and Bridge.&mdash;William Penn the
Quaker.&mdash;Foregate Street and Old Watling Street.&mdash;Post
Office and Old Bank.&mdash;The Eastgate, Roman and

<p><span class="smcap">Presuming</span>, gentle reader, you have
sagaciously chosen <i>us</i> as your companion, we will evince
our desire to be friendly and agreeable by meeting you at the
Station (for doubtless you have only just arrived by train), and
taking you affectionately under our wing, will straightway
introduce you to the chief Lions of Chester.</p>
<p>What think you, in the first place, of our noble <span
class="smcap">Station</span>, with its elegant iron roof of sixty
feet span, and its thirteen miles of railway line?&nbsp; Twenty
years ago, the ground it stands upon, and indeed the
neighbourhood around, were but plain kitchen-gardens and
uninteresting fields.&nbsp; But a marvellous change has been
effected since then, and, as if by enchantment, suburban
Flookersbrook has now become the very life&rsquo;s-blood of the
city.&nbsp; Stretching away on either side of us, as far as the
eye can reach, we see the passengers&rsquo; arrival and departure
sheds, booking offices, refreshment rooms, goods and carriage
depots, waterworks, gasworks, and all the other facilities and
conveniences which are the usual characteristics of the railway
system; while beyond the limits of the Station, and indeed of the
city itself, which here intrenches upon the township of Hoole,
the busy hum of life is ceaselessly heard spreading itself in
every direction, and rapidly transforming the region of the
plough into the turmoil of the town.</p>
<p>This Station is the grand central terminus of six several
lines or branches, all meeting at Chester, viz., the London and
North Western; the Great Western; the Birkenhead, Lancashire, and
Cheshire Junction; the latter company&rsquo;s branch to
Manchester; the Chester and Holyhead; and the Chester and Mold
Railways.&nbsp; It was erected in 1847&ndash;8 at the joint
expense of the four principal companies, and is acknowledged to
be one of the handsomest, as it <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>is certainly one of the most
extensive railway establishments in the kingdom.&nbsp; The
building was designed by C. H. Wild, Esq., C.E., and Mr.
Thompson, of London (the latter the architect of the Derby
station) and was built by that enterprising and well-known
contractor, Mr. Thos. Brassey, whom Cheshire proudly claims as
her son.&nbsp; The passengers&rsquo; shed occupies a space of
ground nearly a quarter of a mile in length, and presents to the
city an elegant fa&ccedil;ade 1010 feet long, and a frontage,
including the house and carriage landings, of 1160 feet.&nbsp; It
is built of dark red fire bricks, relieved with copings and
facings of Stourton stone.&nbsp; At each end of the Station, and
projecting from the main building, there is a shed for cabs and
omnibuses awaiting the arrival of trains, each 290 feet long by
24 feet broad, covered with an iron roof.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p11b.jpg">
<img alt=
"General Railway Station"

"General Railway Station"
 src="images/p11s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>On the inner side of the building is the General Departure
Platform, extending 1010 feet in length by twenty feet in width;
this <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>and
three lines of rails are covered with an exceedingly chaste and
elegant iron roof of sixty feet span, designed and carried out by
Mr. Wild, C.E.&nbsp; Behind this shed again, but visible from the
general platform through the arches, is the spare carriage shed,
600 feet long by fifty-two feet broad.&nbsp; The whole
arrangements of the buildings are admirably adapted to carry on
with comfort to the public and with facility to the
employ&eacute;s, the immense business that has so suddenly been
brought to the city by the convergence of so many railways at
this point.</p>
<p>Some idea may be formed of the extent of the business here
transacted, when it is stated that of passenger trains only,
there now arrive and depart upwards of ninety-eight, averaging
3500 passengers daily, or one and a quarter millions
annually.</p>
<p>The full extent of the passengers&rsquo; station from the
carriage landing at the east end to the one at the west end, is
1160 feet.&nbsp; This noble building is an object of considerable
attraction: it occupies a space of ground a quarter of a mile in
length;&mdash;only half the building appears in our
illustration.&nbsp; Great expedition was displayed by Mr. Brassey
in its erection, for although the first stone was only laid in
August 1847, on the 1st of August 1848 it was publicly opened for
traffic.</p>
<p>The centre of the building, which is two stories in height,
contains in the upper compartments, offices for the General
Station Committee for the Chester and Holyhead, and the Great
Western Railways; while on the ground floor, besides the usual
offices and waiting rooms, we find the noble range of <span
class="smcap">Refreshment Rooms</span>, presided over with
efficient zeal and attention by <span class="smcap">Mr.
Hobday</span>, and his select corps of experienced
assistants.&nbsp; If after your late journey, you feel any of the
cravings of the inner man,&mdash;if dinner
<i>&agrave;-la-mode</i> lie uppermost in your thoughts&mdash;if
you would enjoy an invigorating cup of coffee, unimpeachable
pastry, a good glass of ale, or a fragrant cigar, take a turn in
the <span class="smcap">Refreshment Rooms</span>, and the utmost
wish of your soul will be incontinently gratified.</p>
<p>The entire number of hands employed upon the passenger station
is 109, and in the goods department 130, including clerks,
porters, pointsmen, &amp;c.&nbsp; Between seventy and eighty
goods trains arrive and depart every twenty-four hours, averaging
1600 wagons daily.&nbsp; In 1855, somewhere about 684,000 tons of
goods, minerals and livestock passed under the manipulation of
Mr. H. Parker, general goods manager.&nbsp; The Station Committee
manufacture their own gas, the consumption of which upon this
station is about 6,500,000 <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>feet per annum.&nbsp; The present gas
and waterworks now need to be removed more to the south-east in
order to afford additional station room&mdash;the
<i>smallness</i> of the present immense building being a source
of <i>continual and growing</i> inconvenience. <a

</a></p>
<p>Leaving now the Station, we see upon our left hand the lofty
<span class="smcap">Shot Tower</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lead Works</span> of Messrs. Walker, Parker and
Co., proprietors of a similar establishment near London Bridge;
while on the right our view is obstructed by the handsome and
commodious Bridge which here stretches across the railway, and
connects the city with its suburb, Flookersbrook.&nbsp; Those
carpetbags and cloaks, by-the-bye, however useful they may be in
their way, are but superfluous companions for a jaunt about the
city.&nbsp; Suppose, then, we drop in at the <span
class="smcap">Liver</span>, a most respectable <span
class="smcap">Hotel</span>, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>within hail of the Station, and there
depositing our luggage in one of the cosy bedrooms of that
establishment, we will sally forth on our mission.&nbsp; After
one night&rsquo;s sojourn at this house you&rsquo;ll know
<i>your</i>, hotel, we promise you, for all future time.&nbsp;
Wending our way into the city, along Brook Street, we come in due
course to <span class="smcap">Cowlane Bridge</span>, erected in
1776, when the canal which flows beneath it was originally
projected.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p14b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Chester Cathedral, from Cowlane Bridge"
title=
"Chester Cathedral, from Cowlane Bridge"
 src="images/p14s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>From this point we have our first glimpse of the <span
class="smcap">Cathedral</span> and <span class="smcap">City
Walls</span>, and a venerable sight it is, as our little
illustration sufficiently testifies.&nbsp; Towering aloft above
surrounding objects the <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>sacred fane of St. Werburgh, presents
itself to our view, in all its massive but rugged proportions, as
the mother church of a vast and populous diocese.&nbsp; Of the
Cathedral itself, as also of the Walls, we shall have abundance
to say by-and-bye.</p>
<p>Cast your eye to the right, along the hue of the City Walls,
and at their north-east angle take a distant view of yon reverend
turret, overhanging the Canal.&nbsp; How forcibly does it remind
us that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The days of old, though time has reft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The splendours they once cast,<br />
Yet many a relic still is left<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To shadow forth the past!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People call it, in these days, the <span
class="smcap">Ph&oelig;nix Tower</span>; but two hundred years
ago, and even then it was accounted <i>old</i>, the name it
usually bore was <i>Newton&rsquo;s Tower</i>.&nbsp; On its lofty
ramparts, in 1645, stood the royal martyr, King Charles, to
witness a sanguinary contest not far from the city, which ended
in the total defeat of his troops by the parliamentary
forces.&nbsp; In that day&rsquo;s struggle, and in the Siege that
followed it, many a Chester hero bit the dust; and the roll-call
that evening proclaimed many an infant fatherless, many a wife a
widow!&nbsp; But why should we anticipate?&nbsp; We shall soon be
close to the very walls of this Tower, and may then soliloquise
to our heart&rsquo;s content on those terrible times.</p>
<p>For the present, then, we will move on along Frodsham Street,
anciently called Cowlane, pausing midway to reflect that in the
Quakers&rsquo; Meeting-house, at the corner of Union Walk, Friend
William Penn, the founder of Pennsylvania, held forth to his
admirers, King James II. being on one occasion an attentive
hearer.&nbsp; Continuing on our course a short distance, we
emerge from Cowlane into a wide but irregular street, named
indifferently <span class="smcap">Forest</span> or <span
class="smcap">Foregate Street</span>, the latter, from its
standing immediately before the gate,&mdash;the <span
class="smcap">Eastgate</span>, close by, being always esteemed
<i>the porta principalis</i> of the city.&nbsp; Foregate Street
forms a part of the old Watling Street of the Romans; so that it
existed as a road almost as early as the crucifixion of Our
Lord!&nbsp; Fifty years ago this was as curious a street as any
within the city; but the ancient piazzas which once ran
continuously along it, are now becoming mere specks in the
landscape, and &ldquo;like angels&rsquo; visits, few and far
between.&rdquo;&nbsp; Not far from where we are standing, near
the corner of St. John&rsquo;s Street, are two superior
travellers&rsquo; inns, the <span class="smcap">Hoppole</span>,
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>and the
<span class="smcap">Blossoms</span>, the latter a house of the
highest standing and respectability, admirably adapted for the
accommodation of visitors, and for all those who would enjoy the
comfort of a home combined with the advantages of a first-class
<span class="smcap">Hotel</span>.&nbsp; At the rear of the
Blossoms, in St. John Street, is the <span class="smcap">Post
Office</span>, a neat stuccoed building, erected in 1842, at the
sole expense of William Palin, Esq., the present
post-master.&nbsp; Prior to this, the business of the Post-Office
was conducted in a dark and dreary building, situate up a court,
still known as the Old Post-Office Yard.&nbsp; It was to Rowland
Hill, and his wonder-working penny stamp, that the citizens owed
this satisfactory change from darkness unto light.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Yonder white stone building at the head of St. John Street is
the well-known banking establishment of Messrs. Williams &amp;
Co., usually denominated the Old Bank.&nbsp; And, here, crossing
the street at an altitude of some thirty feet, is the <span
class="smcap">Eastgate</span>, a noble arch, with a postern on
either side, erected in 1769, on the site of <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>a Gateway,
dating back to the days of the Third Edward, by Robert, first
Marquis of Westminster, whose arms, with those of the city,
ornament the keystone of the centre arch.</p>
<p>Handsome and commodious as is the present <span
class="smcap">Eastgate</span>,&mdash;on every score but that of
convenience, it is immeasurably inferior to its
predecessor.&nbsp; Could we but look upon the structure as it
existed only a hundred years ago, with its beautiful Gothic
archway, flanked by two massive octagonal towers, four stories in
height, supporting the Gate itself and the rooms
above,&mdash;could we but resuscitate the time-worn embattlements
of that &ldquo;ancient of days,&rdquo; we should wonder at and
pity the spurious taste that decreed its fall.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
but,&rdquo; we may be told, &ldquo;the present Gate was a public
improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp; A plague upon such improvements, say
we!&nbsp; We should vastly have preferred, and so would every
lover of the antique, whether citizen or stranger, to have
retained the old Gate in its integrity, altered, had need been,
to meet the growing wants of the times, rather than have thus
consigned it to the ruthless hands of the destroyer.&nbsp; Oh! ye
spirits of the valiant dead,&mdash;you who lost your lives
defending this Gate against the cannons of Cromwell, why did ye
not rise up from your graves, and arrest the mad course of that
&ldquo;age of improvement!&rdquo;&nbsp; When this Gate was being
demolished, the massive arches of the original Roman structure
were laid bare to the view, and a portion of one of them is yet
to be seen on the north-west side of the present Gateway.</p>
<p>At this point we will turn away from the street, and,
ascending the steps on the north-east side, will amuse ourselves
in the next chapter with a quiet <span class="smcap">Walk Round
the Walls of Chester</span>.</p>

<p>A <span class="smcap">walk</span> round the Walls of
Chester!&nbsp; Now, then, for a choice
<i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> with the past!&nbsp; Away
with the commonplace nineteenth century!&nbsp; Away with the
mammon-loving world of to-day!&nbsp; The path we are now
treading, high above the busy haunts of men, has a traditionary
halo and interest peculiarly its own.</p>
<p>With the rapidity of thought, our imagination wanders some
eighteen hundred years backwards on the stream of time, to the
days when Marius, King of the Britons, to defend his royal city
from the incursions of his enemies, built up a fortified wall
around Chester.&nbsp; The Britons, however, were no masons; and
their rude defences availed them little when opposed to the
resistless career of Rome.&nbsp; Surrendered to its new masters,
the Romans, Chester speedily gave unmistakeable evidence of the
change.&nbsp; The mud-walls, or earthworks of the conquered,
vanished before the imperial masonry of the conquerors; and the
Walls of Chester, built as only Roman hands could build them,
rose majestically in their place, clasping the city in an embrace
of stone, defiant alike of time and of the foe.</p>
<p>Chester Walls, which afford a continuous promenade, nearly two
miles in circumference, are the only perfect specimen of that
order of ancient fortification now remaining in Britain.&nbsp;
The Walls of Shrewsbury, York, and other places that occur to us,
though interesting enough in their way, yet &ldquo;hide their
diminished heads&rdquo; beside the proud old ramparts of
Chester.&nbsp; Where is the pen or the pencil that can depict the
scenes of glory and renown, so inseparably bound up with the
history of these Walls?&nbsp; For three or four centuries the
Roman soldier kept watch and ward over them, and over the city;
but no sooner had their legions <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>withdrawn from Britain, than the
whole island was shaken to its centre by the ruthless invasion of
the Picts and Goths.&nbsp; Deserted by their old protectors, the
Britons invoked the aid of the Saxons, under Hengist and Horsa;
who, landing at the head of a powerful army, in concert with the
Britons, soon drove the invaders from their quarters within the
Walls of Chester.</p>
<p>The Saxons in turn, perceiving the weakness of the unfortunate
Britons, determined on possessing themselves of the country; and,
during the conflict that ensued, Chester was frequently taken and
retaken by the respective belligerents, and many a fierce and
bloody battle raged beneath its Walls.&nbsp; In 607, for
instance, Ethelred, King of Northumberland, laid siege to the
city; and, after a sanguinary struggle outside the Walls, during
which he put one thousand two hundred British monks to the sword,
wrested the city from its native defenders.&nbsp; Again, however,
the Britons returned to the rescue; and, driving out the
usurpers, retained possession of Chester for more than two
hundred years.</p>
<p>The Danes were the next invaders of old Chester; but, about
the year 908, Ethelred, Earl of Mercia, and Ethelfleda, his
countess, restored the shattered Walls and Gates of the city; in
which state they remained,</p>
<blockquote><p>Bristling with spears, and bright with
burnish&rsquo;d shields,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>through many a long and eventful epoch of England&rsquo;s
history, Chester&rsquo;s faithful safeguard against every
foe.&nbsp; In what good stead they availed the city during the
trying period of the great <span class="smcap">Civil War</span>,
a former chapter has sufficiently declared; and, though we cannot
but rejoice that those days of anarchy and confusion have passed
away, yet are we sure, should the direful necessity again arise,
the hearts of the men of Chester will still beat as loyally, and
their stalwart arms emulate as nobly, the glorious deeds of their
forefathers of yore!&nbsp; And now for our proposed Walk round
these celebrated Walls.</p>
<p>The steps we have just ascended give us but poor &ldquo;first
impressions&rdquo; of the Walls, the view being blocked up on
either side by most unpicturesque buildings.&nbsp; But when we
have proceeded northward a few steps, a prospect of venerable
magnificence suddenly reveals itself.&nbsp; To our left, and so
close that we can hear the organ pealing forth its joyous
hallelujahs, we have a splendid view of the <span
class="smcap">Cathedral</span> of St. Werburgh, seen here,
perhaps, to greater advantage than from any other accessible
point.&nbsp; The first glance will show us that it is a cruciform
structure, as most of our <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>cathedrals are, the massive and
weather-beaten tower standing just in the centre compartment of
the cross.&nbsp; The left wing, though an integral portion of the
building, is, nevertheless, a separate parish church, dedicated
to <span class="smcap">St. Oswald</span>.&nbsp; The choir itself
occupies the entire range of the edifice between us and the
tower, the <i>Chapel of Our Ladye</i> being in the immediate
foreground.&nbsp; At our feet lie numberless memorials of the
dead, which&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>With uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture
deck&rsquo;d,<br />
Implore the passing tribute of a sigh.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This ground has served for a place of sepulture almost since
the Conquest, and has only recently been closed by act of
parliament.</p>
<p>Deferring our special notice of the Cathedral, until &ldquo;a
more convenient season,&rdquo; we shortly find ourselves at the
end of Abbey Street, and immediately over the <span
class="smcap">Kaleyards Gate</span>.&nbsp; This postern leads to
the cabbage and kale gardens, which formerly belonged to the
Abbot and Convent of St. Werburgh.&nbsp; The opening was
permitted to be made for their convenience in the reign of Edward
I. to prevent the necessity of bringing their vegetables by a
circuitous route through the East Gate.&nbsp; The &ldquo;good
things&rdquo; in vogue among these reverend fathers were not, it
is evident, wholly spiritual.&nbsp; A defunct ropery, timberyard,
and infant school now flourish on the spot where monkish cabbages
and conventual kale in old time grew.</p>
<p>A few paces farther on was a quadrangular abutment, on which
formerly stood a tower called <i>The Sadlers&rsquo; Tower</i>,
from its having been the meeting-room of the Company of
Sadlers.&nbsp; This tower was taken down in 1780; and the
abutment, which marked the place where it stood, was demolished
in 1828.</p>
<p>We are now at an interesting portion of the Walls.&nbsp; Do
you see that mouldering old turret some fifty yards a-head of
us?&nbsp; Three hundred years ago it was familiarly known as
Newton&rsquo;s Tower; but the men of the present day call it the
<span class="smcap">Ph&oelig;nix Tower</span>, from the figure of
the ph&oelig;nix, which is the crest of one of the city
companies, ornamenting the front of the structure.&nbsp; Look up,
as we approach it, and read, over its elevated portal, the
startling announcement, that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">KING CHARLES<br />
<span class="smcap">Stood on this Tower</span><br />
<span class="smcap">September</span> 24th, 1645, <span
class="smcap">and saw</span><br />
<span class="smcap">His Army defeated</span><br />
<span class="smcap">On Rowton Moor</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Let us
mount the rugged steps, and having reached the summit, gaze
awhile on the beautiful scene before us.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>To our left is the suburb of Newtown, a creation of the
present century,&mdash;the modest little spire of Christ Church
pointing to the thoughtful wayfarer another and a better
world.&nbsp; Yonder, just visible above the intervening
buildings, the noble fa&ccedil;ade of the Railway Station arrests
the eye.&nbsp; Farther to the right, the Lead Works&rsquo; Shot
Tower again presents itself; while beneath us, at a depth of
about forty feet, the sleepy Canal flows languidly along, scarce
a ripple distracting its glassy surface.&nbsp; The bridge that
crosses it is Cowlane Bridge, whence we obtained the first
glimpse of the Cathedral, <i>en route</i> from the station.&nbsp;
Just over the canal is the new <span class="smcap">Cattle
Market</span>, the Cestrian Smithfield,&mdash;translated hither
from Northgate Street in 1849.&nbsp; That heavy-looking building
just over the Bridge is the Independent Chapel in Queen Street;
while full south, the lofty steeple and church <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>of St. John
&ldquo;lend enchantment to the view.&rdquo;&nbsp; Beyond all
these, some ten or a dozen miles away, the rocky heights of
Beeston salute the eye, capped with the ruins of a Castle, built
by Earl Randle Blundeville,&mdash;a fortress which was several
times taken and retaken by the Royalists and Roundheads in the
great Civil War.&nbsp; To the right again, the stately form of
the fine old Cathedral, like a nursing mother, watches peacefully
o&rsquo;er the city.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">The Walls</span>
beneath us are full of interest to the arch&aelig;ologist, for
through almost their entire length between this Tower and the
Eastgate, the old Roman masonry may yet be distinguished, forming
the lower courses nearest the foundations.</p>
<p>As we once more look up, and read yon quaint yet melancholy
inscription, our minds will of necessity revert back to that sad
September day, when Charles the First stood on this very spot and
saw his gallant cavaliers borne down by the grim soldiers of
Oliver Cromwell&rsquo;s army.&nbsp; For three years he had
maintained a doubtful contest with his Parliament; and though for
a time the successes of his troops in the western counties had
given a fitful gleam of prosperity to his sinking fortunes, the
tide had now turned, and one disaster followed another in quick
succession.&nbsp; On the fields of Naseby and Marston Moor he had
been signally defeated.&nbsp; Bristol had fallen; Prince Rupert
had been disgraced and sent beyond the seas; and the prospect
daily grew darker.&nbsp; Chester remained firm; and hither
Charles had come to encourage his loyal subjects, and give to the
battle which seemed inevitable, the cheering influence of his
kingly presence.&nbsp; The city had been besieged for some
months, and the houses in the suburbs were mostly destroyed.</p>
<p>On the 23rd of September the King entered Chester; and the
next day his troops gave battle to the Parliamentary
forces.&nbsp; Charles, with Sir Francis Gamull the Mayor, here
watched the progress of the contest; and when at last all hope
was gone, and his soldiers fled before the fiery Puritans, he
turned from the melancholy spectacle, descended the steps of this
Tower, and the next day with great difficulty made his escape
from the city.&nbsp; This defeat was but the precursor of worse
misfortunes.&nbsp; Within three years from that day, a crowd was
gathered in front of the Palace at Whitehall.&nbsp; A man in a
mask severed at one blow, the King&rsquo;s head from his body,
and another, holding up the ghastly countenance to the view of
the weeping spectators, cried aloud, &ldquo;This is the head of a
traitor!&rdquo;&nbsp; England was not many years discovering who
were the real traitors.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Charles
had left Chester in worthy hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you do not
receive relief in eight days,&rdquo; said he to Lord Byron, who
was in command, &ldquo;surrender the garrison.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
appointed time passed away, but no relief came.&nbsp; Day after
day for four months, the citizens of Chester, with a courage and
determination that claim our admiration, refused the oft-repeated
summons to surrender.&nbsp; But there was an enemy within the
walls, far more formidable than the troops without.&nbsp; Famine
proved more powerful than the sword.&nbsp; When the provisions
were exhausted, as a last resource the horses were slaughtered
and given out in small rations.&nbsp; Dogs and cats were eaten as
dainties; and many of the inhabitants perished from the dreadful
hardships which were brought to their homes.&nbsp; The men were
not alone in this gallant defence.&nbsp; &ldquo;The women,&rdquo;
says an old chronicler, &ldquo;like so many valiant Amazons, do
out-face death and dare danger, though it lurk in every basket;
seven are shot and three slain&mdash;yet they scorn to leave
their matchless undertaking, and thus they continue for ten
days&rsquo; space; possessing the beholders that they are
immortal.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last, reduced to the utmost extremity,
and all hope of relief being gone, the city surrendered on
condition that the public and private buildings should be
unharmed by the Parliamentary troops.&nbsp; The churches still
bear melancholy witness to the manner in which this solemn
compact was regarded; and the organ and choir of the Cathedral
were broken and defaced, with a Vandalism whose traces yet tell
of the horrors of civil war.</p>
<p>So much then for the Ph&oelig;nix Tower, and its historical
associations.&nbsp; We must now move on to the westward, taking
note on our way of <span class="smcap">Upton Church</span> and
spire, lying just upon the northern confines of the city.</p>
<p>Below us stretches away the <span class="smcap">Canal</span>,
which, here usurping the place of the ancient <i>fosse</i>,
skirts the entire city, within the Walls, from east to
west.&nbsp; Bidding a friendly adieu to the Dean&rsquo;s Field,
that beautiful mead on our left, we approach by a slight incline
the <span class="smcap">North Gate</span> of the city.&nbsp; Look
now over the right-hand parapet upon the yawning gulf below, and
reflect that, while yon arch was built by an architect of our own
time, that course of stones beneath us&mdash;the dark ones
between the ivy and the abutment&mdash;was laid by a Roman mason,
when Rome herself was mistress of the world.</p>
<p>Ascending two or three steps, we find ourselves on the top of
the <span class="smcap">North Gate</span>, which here, with its
neat elliptical arch, divides <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>Upper from Lower North Gate
Street.&nbsp; That new-looking red-brick building beneath us is
the <span class="smcap">Blue-Coat Hospital</span>, a charity
school, under the same roof with the ancient Hospital of St.
John,&mdash;of both which institutions more anon.</p>
<p>Pass we on now still to the westward, until we come to a
curious watch-tower, called <span class="smcap">Morgan&rsquo;s
Mount</span>, having a lower chamber on the level of the Walls,
and an open platform above, accessible by a few winding
steps.&nbsp; During the Siege of Chester, a battery was planted
on the summit of this tower, and from its commanding position,
surrounded by earthworks, successfully kept the besiegers at
bay.&nbsp; Let us mount to the top, and survey the diversified
prospect before us.&nbsp; See yonder Elizabethan building at the
northwest extremity of the city, beautifully placed on a hill,
and separated from us by those fine, dark, evergreen trees,
through which you can see the bright sunshine, as it were,
smiling approvingly upon it.&nbsp; It is the Diocesan <span
class="smcap">Training College</span>, a normal establishment,
for preparing masters and teachers for the parochial schools of
the diocese.&nbsp; Stretching away to our left is the Hundred of
Wirrall, the foreground dotted here and there with a handsome
mansion or substantial farm-house, among which those of Crabwall,
Mollington, and Blacon, are most conspicuous.&nbsp; That house,
so sweetly situate on the eminence to the left, embowered in
trees, is Blacon Point, commanding extensive views of the city
and North Wales.&nbsp; Still beneath us flows the Canal, which,
however, empties itself, close at hand, by a series of descending
locks, into the River Dee.&nbsp; That pile of buildings on the
opposite bank of the Canal, is the central official establishment
of the Shropshire Union Railway Company.&nbsp; The River Dee, the
mountains of North Wales, and the ancient Walls, serve nobly to
complete this glowing panorama of nature, and of art.</p>
<p>Once more, forward!&mdash;but only for a few steps; for here
we are arrived at another Tower, originally twice its present
height, and at one time denominated the <i>Goblin&rsquo;s
Tower</i> (doubtless for some <i>ghostly</i> reason), but of late
better known as <span class="smcap">Pemberton&rsquo;s
Parlour</span>.&nbsp; Though now semicircular, this was, in all
probability, a round or octagonal tower when first erected,
having a passage through for pedestrians.&nbsp; Be that as it
may, in 1702, being in a ruinous state, a great part of it was
taken down, and the remainder repaired.&nbsp; The side towards
the Walls was refaced and ornamented with some fine heraldic
sculpture; and an inscription, now almost obliterated, proclaimed
that in a certain &ldquo;year of the glorious reign of Queen
Anne, divers wide breaches in these Walls were <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>re-built, and
other decays therein were repaired; 2000 yards of the pavement
were new flagged or paved, and the whole repaired, regulated, and
adorned, at the expense of &pound;1000 and upwards.&nbsp; Thomas
Hand, Esq., Mayor, 1701.&nbsp; The Right Honourable William, Earl
of Derby, Mayor, 1702, who died in his Mayoralty.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Passing on from ivy-capt <i>Pemberton&rsquo;s Parlour</i>, we
see on our left hand, through that refreshing grove of trees, a
large and verdant mead, still retaining its ancient name of the
<i>Barrow Field</i>, or <i>Lady Barrow&rsquo;s Hay</i>.&nbsp;
This is the place where the soldiers of old Rome went through
their daily military exercises, and where, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>1500 years
afterwards, great numbers of the citizens who died of the plague
were hurriedly interred.&nbsp; We are now upon a flat iron
Bridge, and whew! with a rush like that of a tiger from his den,
the giant of the nineteenth century&mdash;a steam-engine and
train&mdash;emerge from the dark tunnel which passes under the
city, and dash away beneath us, full forty miles an hour, <i>en
route</i> to Ireland, by way of Holyhead.&nbsp; The Roman Walls,
that resisted so successfully the Roundhead batteries, have in
our own times succumbed to the engines of peace, and the railway
trains, with their living freight, now career it merrily through
two neighbouring apertures in these ancient fortifications.</p>
<p>A little farther ahead are some modern steps, leading down to
the new <span class="smcap">Baths</span> and <span
class="smcap">Washhouses</span>, in which is a capacious
swimming-bath, where plebeians may indulge in a plunge for a
penny, and where hot and cold shower and vapour baths are at the
service of the public on equally reasonable terms.&nbsp; Previous
to the erection of these Baths, the only means of egress from the
city at this point was by an ancient postern underneath us, now
blocked up.</p>
<p>Wheeling sharp round to the left, for the Walls here take a
direction southward, we cross a second Railway Bridge, and then
turn to regale ourselves with an immediate foreground of
startling interest.&nbsp; We are looking upon a Tower erected in
1322, by one Helpstone, a mason, who contracted to build it for
100<i>l.</i>, a high price in those days, when workmen for their
day&rsquo;s wage, &ldquo;received but every man his
penny.&rdquo;&nbsp; It consists of a higher and lower tower, the
former being distinguished by the break jaw name of
<i>Bonewaldesthorne&rsquo;s Tower</i>, and connected by a steep
flight of steps and an embattled terrace with the lower or <span
class="smcap">Water Tower</span>.&nbsp; This tower was erected
while the tidal waters of the Dee flowed up to Chester Walls; and
within the memory of man the rings and bolts were to be seen
about the old turret, to which, centuries ago, the ships that
came up to the city were safely moored.&nbsp; The case is altered
now, and, thanks to the duplicity of a public company,
&ldquo;Deva&rsquo;s wizard stream&rdquo; ebbs and flows almost in
vain for &ldquo;rare old Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Stone walls
tell no tales,&rdquo; says the proverb; but yon crumbling old
ruin, so stern, so ragged, so venerable to look upon, tells us in
plain though silent language its own unvarnished tale.&nbsp; Look
at its broken and serrated surface, its disfigured
battlements?&nbsp; Think you old Time alone has wrought all
this?&nbsp; Turn to the annals of the city, and there read that
the Roundhead battery on Bruera&rsquo;s Hall hill yonder played
its artillery fiercely against this tower during the great Civil
War; and though its fair <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>form was shattered, its buttresses
shaken by the terrible cannonade, yet the proud old structure
remained intact, and the hearts of its defenders unfaltering,
through the whole of that fierce and lamentable struggle.&nbsp;
The scenes then enacted have passed away, as we hope for ever,
and this venerable stronghold has become subservient to another
and more peaceful purpose, as a local and general antiquarian
<span class="smcap">Museum</span>.&nbsp; Of course we must go in
and examine it for ourselves, and think, as we do so, with
becoming honour of the gallant spirits who once kept watch and
ward over its safety.&nbsp; It will cost us just sixpence each to
pass in; but never mind that, were the charge a crown, it would
not have been money injudiciously thrown away.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p27b.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Water Tower, Railway, and City Walls"

 src="images/p27s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The room we have passed into is the ancient keep, formerly
known as <span class="smcap">Bonewaldesthorne&rsquo;s
Tower</span>; and after ruminating a moment on the rusty swords
and rapiers that hang around, we will mount the winding staircase
into the room above.&nbsp; Here, on <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a whitened table, the light of day
being first excluded, we are introduced to the wondrous
revelations of the <span class="smcap">Camera
Obscura</span>.&nbsp; On this little table we have pourtrayed,
with minute but pleasing accuracy, every place and occurrence
within gunshot of the Tower,&mdash;boats on the Canal,
pedestrians on the Walls, ships on the Dee, green fields and
trees, the flying train, and every passing incident, ridiculous
or sublime.&nbsp; From this Tower we proceed by a steep descent
of zig-zag steps, between rugged battlements of venerable
sandstone, thickly coated with &ldquo;that rare old plant, the
ivy green,&rdquo; to the centre of attraction, the <span
class="smcap">Water Tower</span> itself.&nbsp; How beautiful, how
indescribably beautiful, are those thick masses of dark, glossy,
green ivy, &ldquo;creeping where no life is seen&rdquo; round the
blackened old ramparts we have just passed by!</p>
<p>The iron gate or portcullis opens at our approach, and we
enter a spacious room, once bristling with hosts of armed men,
but now filled with curiosities and natural productions from
every quarter of the globe.&nbsp; A corkscrew staircase brings us
to a similar room on the second story; while higher still, upon
the leads of the Tower, where the stalwart warrior once paced his
silent round, the observant visitor may feast his eyes on a
varied scene of wood and dale, mountain and river, garden and
field, of surpassing interest.&nbsp; To give anything like a
detail of the curiosities and antiquities stored up in this Tower
would fill an ordinary volume; let it suffice, then, to point out
a few of the more prominent and striking.&nbsp; Here is a large
and beautiful collection of shells, scientifically arranged, the
gift of Captain T. L. Massie, R.N., and there a case of
Australian birds, presented to the Museum by another worthy
citizen.&nbsp; In yonder glass-case we have, at one view,
specimens of almost every known variety of British birds, from
the majestic bittern to the diminutive jenny wren.&nbsp; Here is
the &ldquo;old arm-chair&rdquo; of Bishop Goodman, one of the
worthiest prelates of our renowned Queen Bess.&nbsp; Here again
are trophies of battle and victory from Inkermann and Alma; and
there are glass cases of Greek, Roman, and British coins, from
the penny bearing the &ldquo;image and superscription of
C&aelig;sar,&rdquo; to the chaste medallions of our own beloved
Queen.&nbsp; There, too, is the skull of a soldier killed during
the Civil War, in the neighbourhood of Beeston Castle, the deadly
impress of two flattened bullets being still visible on the
skull.&nbsp; Those blackened fragments you are now surveying are
the hand and foot of an Egyptian mummy, the owner of which may
possibly have been a contemporary of Pharaoh.&nbsp; Doubtless
this mummy, when in life, was a confirmed <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>old maid; for
see, here is her favourite <i>cat</i>, embalmed like herself, and
found by her side when she was exhumed.&nbsp; The cat was a
sacred animal with the ancient Egyptians.&nbsp; We might linger
here profitably a whole day, but having other fish to fry, we
must bid farewell to the Water Tower and its obliging attendants,
and remounting the lofty steps, find ourselves once more on the
venerable Walls.</p>
<p>Resuming now our walk, we approach a large and handsome brick
building, on the city side of the Walls.&nbsp; This is the
Chester <span class="smcap">Infirmary</span>, and a most useful
and valuable institution it is, having been founded in 1755 by
Dr. Stratford, of Chester, and supported entirely by the
contributions of the charitable in Cheshire and North
Wales.&nbsp; The present structure was erected in 1761, and has
accommodation under its roof for one hundred patients, besides
spacious hot, cold, and vapour baths, and all the usual adjuncts
of a first class hospital.&nbsp; The upper story on the north
side of the building is set apart for a fever ward; and in this,
as in every other beneficial arrangement, the Chester Infirmary
is second to none in the kingdom.&nbsp; The honorary medical
staff consists of three physicians and three surgeons; and from
these, and the worthy house surgeon and matron, the patients
receive the utmost assistance that human kindness and skill can
bestow.&nbsp; The halt and maimed, the sick and dying of the
poorer classes are here watched with anxious care, and experience
comforts to which at home or elsewhere they would necessarily be
strangers.</p>
<p>The Infirmary was founded for the eradication of one species
of evils; but here is a building for the suppression of evils of
another description.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">City
Gaol</span>, for such is the gloomy-looking structure before us,
is an erection of the present century, having supplanted the old
and ruinous prison which formerly stood upon the site of the
present North Gate.&nbsp; Over the handsome Doric entrance is an
iron railing, within which the last sentence of the law is
occasionally executed on condemned criminals.&nbsp; Surely the
day is not far distant when &ldquo;death by the hangman&rdquo;
will be a punishment unknown to the criminal code of
England!&nbsp; What adds to the evil, so far as Chester is
concerned, is that the authorities of the City are compelled, by
some antediluvian charter, to see execution done on every
condemned criminal within the County, though for what reason this
especial <i>honour</i> was first conferred on the citizens, is an
enigma susceptible of no clear solution.</p>
<p>A short distance hence is Stanley Place, a double row of <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>genteel
residences; at the head of which, within that ponderous gateway,
is the old <span class="smcap">Linen Hall</span>, once the great
mart for Irish linens, but of late, owing to the decay of that
branch of trade, consecrated to the sale of the famed Cheshire
cheese.&nbsp; What! have you never yet tasted a bit of
&ldquo;prime old Cheshire?&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us recommend you then
to do so, on your return to the Inn; and if your fancy does not
gloat over it for a month or two to come, our belief in your
<i>good taste</i> will be considerably modified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onward!&rdquo; is again the word, and ascending a short
incline, we find ourselves on the top of another of the four
great Gates of the city.&nbsp; We are now exactly opposite to
where we set out, and have, therefore, at least half completed
our circuit of the city.&nbsp; The West, or as it is more usually
termed, the <span class="smcap">Water Gate</span> (from the Dee
having originally flowed up to its portals), is like the East and
North Gates, a modern structure, having replaced the old and
unsightly archway in 1789, as appears by an inscription on the
west side.&nbsp; The custody of Chester Gates was at one time a
privilege much courted by the high and mighty in the land.&nbsp;
Thus the sergeantship of the East Gate has belonged since the
time of Edward I. to the ancestors of the present Lord Crewe, of
Crewe; the North Gate during that period has been in charge of
the citizens; the Water Gate, on which we are now standing, in
custody of the Stanleys, Earls of Derby; while the Bridge Gate,
to which we shall presently come, belonged to the Earls of
Shrewsbury, inheriting from their ancestors, the Troutbecks and
Rabys, sergeants thereof in the fourteenth century.&nbsp; Below
us lies a plain of sweetest verdure and most inviting beauty; and
by way of diversifying our subject, we will now step down from
the Gate and Walls, and find ourselves, in another chapter,
treading the green sward of the old Roodeye.</p>
<h2><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><span class="smcap">Well</span>, here we are, on a beautiful
meadow, eighty-four acres in extent, clad in Nature&rsquo;s own
mantle of brightest green, and bearing the euphonious name of the
<span class="smcap">Roodeye</span>.&nbsp; This splendid pasture,
now so cheerful to look upon, has not always worn the same gay
aspect.&nbsp; In ages past and gone&mdash;when the Saxon and the
Norman held sway over the land&mdash;when colossal Liverpool was
but a simple fishing-hamlet&mdash;the infant commerce of England
was borne along the surging billows of the Dee, up to the very
Walls of Chester.&nbsp; In those days the spacious lawn before us
was covered with water at every tide, save only a bank or eye of
land near the centre, which being surmounted by a plain
substantial stone cross, acquired the name of the <span
class="smcap">Roodeye</span>, or the <i>Island of the
Cross</i>.&nbsp; Are you fond of legends?&mdash;Here then is one
that may gratify your taste.</p>
<p>Once upon a time (you must not ask <i>when</i>) the Christians
of Hawarden, a few miles down the river, were in a sad strait for
lack of rain.&nbsp; Now it so happened that in the church of that
place there stood an image of the Virgin Mary, called Holy
Rood.&nbsp; To her shrine then repaired the faithful and fearful
of all classes to pray for rain.&nbsp; Among the rest, Lady
Trawst, the wife of the governor of Hawarden, prayed so heartily
and so long, that the image, grown desperate we suppose, fell
down upon the lady and killed her.&nbsp; Mad with rage at this
&ldquo;answer to their prayers,&rdquo; a jury of the inhabitants
was summoned, and the Holy Rood summarily convicted of wilful
murder and other heinous sins.&nbsp; Fearful, however, of the
consequences if they executed the offender, the jury determined
to lay her upon the beach at low water; whence the next tide
carried her away to the spot where she was found, <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>under the
Walls of Chester.&nbsp; The citizens held a <i>post-mortem</i>
examination, and seeing that she was <i>Holy Rood</i>, decided on
burying her where she was found, and erected over her a simple
stone Cross, which, tradition says, once bore an inscription to
the following effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Jews their God did crucify,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hardeners theirs did drown:<br />
Because their wants she&rsquo;d not supply,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And she lies under this cold stone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another version affirms she was carried to <span
class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s Church</span>, and there set up in
great pomp, and that this Cross was erected on the spot where she
was found.</p>
<p>So much for the legend: yonder is the remnant of the Cross
under which her holiness was laid; and as</p>
<blockquote><p>Little she&rsquo;ll reck, if they&rsquo;ll let her
sleep on,<br />
We will leave her alone in her glory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The spot now marks the boundary of St. Mary&rsquo;s
parish.&nbsp; The athletic sports and Olympian games of the
Romans, the military displays of the Edwards and Henries, the
pageants and plays of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
were each in their day &ldquo;set forth&rdquo; on the Roodeye
before hundreds of wondering and admiring citizens.&nbsp; And it
is pretty much the same &ldquo;even in this our day;&rdquo; for
martial reviews and rejoicings, cricket and other athletic games
are all celebrated and fostered on its rich green sward.</p>
<p>Why, it was only the other day, on the 2nd of April, 1856,
that the rank and beauty of the county (and that beauty does
reign dominant in Cheshire all the world knows) assembled on the
<span class="smcap">Roodeye</span> to witness a grand and
exciting ceremonial.&nbsp; For two years war had been convulsing
Europe; Turkey the weak had been marked out for a prey by Russia
the strong; the Eagle of the North would have trampled on the
Crescent, and have blotted out its name from the catalogue of
nations.&nbsp; But the British lion looked on from
afar,&mdash;the champion of the weak girded on its ancient
strength,&mdash;and with the aid of France, once its enemy, but
now a gallant ally, went forth to the rescue.&nbsp; The result is
patent to the world.&nbsp; In two short years the pride of the
despot has been humbled, and the freedom of his almost victim
assured, while Peace once again spreads its mantle over the
earth.&nbsp; The militia of England formed the nursery at home
for the army <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>abroad; and the militia of Cheshire in particular
responded nobly to the repeated demands of their country.&nbsp;
No wonder, then, that the Roodeye was so crowded and gay on the
occasion in question,&mdash;that so many desired to witness the
presentation of new banners to the gallant 1st Regiment of Royal
Cheshire Militia.&nbsp; The Marchioness of Westminster, as the
representative of the Lord Lieutenant, presented the colours,
which were first duly consecrated by the amiable Bishop of the
diocese.&nbsp; <i>We</i> were present at the ceremony; and, as
the ensigns of the regiment received their handsome banners, and
unfurled them to the breeze, we felt a glow of pride upon our
cheek that the ancient chivalry of Cheshire still animated her
loyal sons.&nbsp; England has once more had to learn, and will
surely not this time forget the lesson, that &ldquo;the only way
to be certain of peace, is to be at all times amply prepared for
war.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>But the Roodeye is perhaps chiefly famous for the splendid
horse Races which are twice a-year held here; and while the
course <a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>itself is a perfect amphitheatre, and the
spectator&rsquo;s view of the contests magnificent and unbroken,
it is not too much to say, that the fame of <span
class="smcap">Chester Races</span> is a household word with every
true lover of old English sports.&nbsp; Our illustration presents
to us a view of the handsome <span class="smcap">Grand
Stand</span>, with the Walls and Water Gate on the left; but for
a more general view of the entire race-course, we may profitably
refer to the frontispiece at the commencement of our <span
class="smcap">Guide</span>.&nbsp; The viaduct on the extreme left
is, with the girder-bridge over the Dee, the iron road of
communication between England and Ireland; while beyond it,
again, lies the &ldquo;Port of Chester;&rdquo; as also the <span
class="smcap">Roodeye Gas Works</span>, <span
class="smcap">Workhouse</span>, and last, not least, the iron
shipbuilding yard, conducted by Mr. Cram, of this city.</p>
<p>We will now return to the <span class="smcap">Walls</span>,
noticing as we pass through the Water Gate, to the right, the
remains of the wall of the <i>Black Friars&rsquo;
Monastery</i>.&nbsp; Proceeding southward a short distance, we
arrive at a field, on the left hand, in which formerly stood the
Benedictine <i>Nunnery of St. Mary</i>.&nbsp; Within living
memory, portions of this conventual establishment were visible
from the Walls, but all traces thereof are now unfortunately
obliterated.&nbsp; We have here a pretty close view of the <span
class="smcap">Castle</span>, <span class="smcap">Savings
Bank</span>, and <span class="smcap">St. Bridget&rsquo;s
Church</span>; but as we have now arrived at the New, or
Grosvenor Road, we will approach still nearer, and while
surveying and admiring the Castle of the present, ruminate a
little on the Castle of past days.</p>
<p>When Chester Castle was first erected, whether during the
British, Roman or Saxon occupation, is a problem likely never to
be determined.&nbsp; There can be no question, however, that it
existed some time previous to the Norman Conquest; for it was the
chosen court and camp of Hugh Lupus the Norman, nephew of the
Conqueror, and is stated by Camden to have been merely
<i>repaired</i> by that powerful baron.&nbsp; On the death of the
last Norman Earl, the Castle passed into the hands of the king
(Henry III.).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Henry of Lancaster, (afterwards Henry IV.) having taken
up arms against Richard II., in 1399, mustered his army upon the
banks of the Dee, under the Walls of Chester, and Sir Piers Legh
of Lyme, an adherent of Richard, was beheaded, and his head set
upon the top of the highest tower in the Castle.&nbsp; A few days
afterwards, the unfortunate Richard and the Earl of Salisbury
were brought prisoners to Chester, mounted (says Hall)
&lsquo;upon two little nagges, not worth forty francs,&rsquo;
when the King was delivered &lsquo;to the <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>Duke of
Gloucester&rsquo;s sonne and the Earle of Arundell&rsquo;s sonne,
that loved him but a little, for he had put their fathers to
death, who led him strait to the Castell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In 1403, Henry Percy, the renowned Hotspur, visited
Chester, on his way to the fatal field of Shrewsbury, and caused
proclamation to be made, that King Richard was yet alive, and a
prisoner in Chester Castle, where he might be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester, wife of the <i>Good
Duke Humphrey</i>, was confined for several months in Chester
Castle, in 1447, previous to her removal to the Isle of Man,
under a sentence of perpetual imprisonment on a charge of
&lsquo;practising the King&rsquo;s death.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, in 1651, the Puritans &lsquo;<i>sought the
Lord</i>&rsquo; by trying and condemning to death the gallant and
patriotic Earl of Derby, Sir Timothy Featherstonehaugh, and
Captain Benbow.&nbsp; According to Whitlocke, the Earl
&lsquo;attempted to escape, and was let down by a rope from the
leads of his chamber; but some hearing a noise, made after him,
and he was re-taken upon Dee bank.&rsquo;&nbsp; He was afterwards
beheaded at Bolton, while Featherstonehaugh was shot in the
market-place of Chester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now for the Castle of the present day.&nbsp; The old
structure was removed towards the close of the eighteenth
century, and the new one erected from the plans of the late
Thomas Harrison, Esq., the architect of the Grosvenor Bridge.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Grand Entrance</span> occupies the
centre of a semicircular fosse, and is of the Grecian Doric
order.&nbsp; The whole of the majestic fluted columns of this
Gateway and of the Shire Hall, are constructed each, from capital
to base, of a single stone.&nbsp; As we pass into the <span
class="smcap">Castle Yard</span>, we have at one view a fine
prospect of this noble square.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The two wings of the Castle, and the whole of the
buildings to the right, are appropriated to the military; the
centre to the Assize Court and County Gaol.&nbsp; The right wing
is the officer&rsquo;s barracks.&nbsp; There are at present in
this Castle, a regiment of militia, and a battalion of
artillery.&nbsp; The pensioners&rsquo; offices are at the back of
the left wing, at one side of which is the Nisi Prius Court,
Grand Jury Room, &amp;c.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first floor of the new barracks on the higher wards
is appropriated to the <i>Armoury</i>, which contains 30,000
stand of arms, and is decorated with various devices, formed
solely of weapons of warfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Near these buildings is an old Square Tower, called
<i>Julius </i><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span><i>C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s</i>, otherwise <i>Julius
Agricola&rsquo;s Tower</i>, in which was situated the <i>Chantry
of St. Mary infra Castrum</i>.&nbsp; It was in this Chapel that
James II. received Mass during his stay in Chester.&nbsp; This
Tower was built soon after the Norman Conquest.&nbsp; There was
an ancient fresco painting on the interior walls, the subject of
which was Moses receiving the Table of Commandments from the
Mount, whilst the Devil in a nondescript form is trying to seize
them; in the back-ground are his old friends <i>the Pope</i>, and
a group of ecclesiastical personages.&nbsp; This Tower was newly
cased with red stone in 1818.&nbsp; The Powder Magazine is at
present kept in it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Close by stood, prior to its
demolition, the ancient Shire Hall and Exchequer Court: the
latter was the parliament house of the palatinate earls, and had
neat carved seats for the earl and his eight barons, spiritual
and temporal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

 src="images/p36s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;As before stated, the centre buildings contain the
Assize Court and City Gaol.&nbsp; In front of the Hall of Justice
is a portico, <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>supported by twelve pillars in double rows.&nbsp; The
entrances are at the sides of the portico.&nbsp; The interior of
the Court is of a semicircular form, forty-four feet high, eighty
feet diameter, and forty-four feet wide.&nbsp; Round the
semicircle is a colonnade of twelve Ionic pillars, supporting a
semi-dome, divided into four square compartments, richly
embellished.&nbsp; The <i>tout ensemble</i> is grand and
imposing, and admirably adapted to give a majestic appearance to
a judicial court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behind this building is the Constable&rsquo;s
residence, a terrace in front of which commands a view of the
Chapel, and Felons&rsquo; Yards below, five in number.&nbsp; The
Debtors&rsquo; Yards form quadrangles on the right and left of
the Constable&rsquo;s house, on a level with the Castle
Yard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Churches of St. Mary, and St. Bridget, are both within a
stone&rsquo;s throw; but we must leave them for the present, and
continue our interesting &ldquo;Walk round the
Walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a few minutes we arrive at the angle of
the Walls, where the massive ramparts of the Castle frown
majestically above us, while below, the classic waters of the Dee
flow languidly on, regardless of yon noble and magnificent stone
Bridge, which, with its unequalled single arch of 200 feet span,
crosses the river a short distance away from us.&nbsp; This is
the <span class="smcap">Grosvenor Bridge</span>, finished in
1832, at a cost of 30,000<i>l.</i> and formally opened in October
of that year, by Her present Most Gracious Majesty, then Princess
Victoria.&nbsp; It has the reputation of being the <i>largest
stone arch in the world</i>.&nbsp; Immediately to the left of the
Bridge is the Cemetery, of which more hereafter.</p>
<p>Again we pass onwards, having on our left the higher wards of
the Castle, Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Tower, and the lofty
boundary wall of the new County Gaol.&nbsp; C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s
Tower (so called) has of late years been converted into a powder
magazine, and may, some day or other, make itself both heard and
felt by the citizens, unless they procure the removal of the
magazine to some more distant and fitting locality.</p>
<p>Still onwards, by the side of the Dee, and we approach the Old
Dee Bridge and Mills, having on the opposite shore the suburb of
<span class="smcap">Handbridge</span>, called by the Welsh
<i>Treboeth</i>, or <i>burnt town</i>, from its having been so
often razed to the ground during their predatory
incursions.&nbsp; Yonder is <span class="smcap">Edgar&rsquo;s
Field</span>, so called from the palace of that Saxon monarch
having been traditionally situate there.&nbsp; In this field is a
projecting rock, partially excavated, still bearing the name of
<span class="smcap">Edgar&rsquo;s Cave</span>; and the tradition
is that, in 971, that monarch was rowed from thence to St.
John&rsquo;s Church by six petty <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>kings or princes, in token of their
subjection to his rule.&nbsp; At the entrance of the cave is a
rude sculpture, supposed to represent Minerva, accompanied by her
usual symbol, the owl.</p>
<p>Where we are now standing was, fifty years ago, an ancient
postern, called the <span class="smcap">Shipgate</span>, or
<i>Sheepgate</i>, from which went a ford across the river into
Handbridge.&nbsp; The gate itself, of Roman construction, on
being taken down, was carefully preserved, and now ornaments the
garden of the present town clerk, J. Finchett-Maddock, Esq., in
Abbey Square.</p>
<p>A few steps further will bring us to the South or <span
class="smcap">Bridge Gate</span>, the last of the four principal
Gates of the city.&nbsp; It is a bold and imposing structure,
erected, in 1782, at the expense of the corporation, in place of
the old and ponderous gateway which previously occupied its
site.&nbsp; The old Gate is quoted in deeds as far back as the
twelfth century, and appears to have been granted by the Norman
Earl Randle and his Countess to one Poyns, their servant, for
some meritorious but unrecorded service.&nbsp; From his
successors it passed, through Philip le Clerc, to the families of
Raby, Norris, and Troutbeck, until the honour of &ldquo;custodian
of the Bridge Gate&rdquo; became vested at length in the Earls of
Shrewsbury, who, in the seventeenth century, sold their rights to
the Corporation.</p>
<p>Crossing over the Bridge Gate, we have now a better view of
the <span class="smcap">Dee Mills</span>, a massive pile of
buildings, resting on the south-west end of the Old Bridge.&nbsp;
The Dee Mills existed on this very spot shortly after the Norman
Conquest, and were for centuries a source of immense revenue to
their owners, the Earls.&nbsp; Edward the Black Prince, as Earl
of Chester, granted them for life to Sir Howel-y-Fwyal, constable
of Criccaeth Castle, for his gallant conduct at the Battle of
Poictiers; since which time they have passed through successive
owners to the Wrench family, who are the present
possessors.&nbsp; The Mills have been thrice destroyed by
fire.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Dee Bridge</span> is of great
antiquity, having been erected in 1280 by the citizens, under a
peremptory order to that effect from King Edward I.&nbsp;
Previous to that date there had been a <i>wooden bridge</i> here,
originating with that amazonian &ldquo;edifier&rdquo; of Chester,
the Mercian Princess Ethelfleda; but that passage was continually
subject to interruptions, both from the violence of the tides,
and the restless zeal of the Welshmen,&mdash;hence the erection
of the present Bridge.&nbsp; It consists at present of seven
arches of irregular size, but is said to have originally boasted
of two or three more, now <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>built up.&nbsp; It was widened in
1826, by the addition of a projecting footpath, seven feet wide,
which has somewhat destroyed its antiquated appearance from this
point of view.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Causeway</span>, or weir, on this side
the Bridge, is recorded to have been first built by Hugh Lupus,
the Conqueror&rsquo;s nephew, probably about the time of the
foundation of the Dee Mills.&nbsp; It stemmed the tide of the
Dee, and of all opposition, until the period of the Commonwealth,
when we find an order of parliament commanding the destruction of
both Causeway and Mills; but the puritanical order appears to
have been derisively set at nought; at all events, it was never
carried out.&nbsp; An American author, writing upon this topic,
facetiously remarks:&mdash;&ldquo;The <i>dam</i> was built, I
don&rsquo;t know when.&nbsp; The Puritans, they say, tried to
destroy it&mdash;for its <i>bad name</i>, perhaps&mdash;but could
not, because, like a duck, it kept under a high flood of water,
until the Cavaliers, making a rush to save it, spiked their
guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wending our way to the eastward, we have before us a long and
interesting stretch of the meandering Dee, crossed at some
distance away by a chaste, yet gossamer-looking bridge, erected
in 1852, by Enoch Gerrard, Esq., the projector and proprietor of
<span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Park</span>, that beautiful
range of building land on the opposite side of the river.&nbsp;
Those steps on the right, leading down to the river side, are
usually known as the <i>Recorder&rsquo;s Steps</i>, from their
having been erected in 1700, for the accommodation of Roger
Comberbach, Esq., then Recorder of Chester.</p>
<p>The Walls here run at a great height above the roadway, until
we turn quick round to the northward, at a lofty flight of steps,
called the <span class="smcap">Wishing Steps</span>.&nbsp; And
why the <i>Wishing Steps</i>, you ask?&nbsp; Listen, and you
shall hear.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a small bit of &ldquo;folk
lore&rdquo; bound up with these Steps, and we never pass by them
without recalling to mind our boyhood&rsquo;s attempts to master
the difficulty.&nbsp; We were always told when a child, and we
heartily believe it as a man, that whosoever shall stand at the
foot of these steps, and <i>wish</i> for any mundane
blessing&mdash;be it the gold of Ophir, aye, or even Paradise
itself&mdash;and (mind this!) run up to the head, down to the
bottom, and up again to the top of these steps, without taking
breath, shall have his fondest wish fulfilled, though it were to
the half of the kingdom!&nbsp; The secret is, that no one could
possibly accomplish the feat without taking breath some half
dozen times.</p>
<p>From the top of the Wishing Steps we have a beautiful prospect
of the banks of the Dee, and of the south-eastern environs of the
<a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>city.&nbsp; From an altitude of some sixty feet, we see
beneath us the stream of Deva in all but repose, for above the
Causeway the River assumes almost the smoothness of a lake.&nbsp;
The iron <span class="smcap">Suspension Bridge</span>, which
crosses it midway, and unites the city with its handsome suburb,
<span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Park</span>, forms a pretty
object in the landscape.&nbsp; Though of such spider-like
construction, its capabilities and strength have been fully
tested.&nbsp; Mr. Dredge, upon whose patent principle the bridge
was erected, thus describes it:&mdash;&ldquo;The Queen&rsquo;s
Park Bridge is 262 feet span, and 417 long, resting upon massive
block masonry (about 3000 cubical feet), which is all below the
surface as foundation, and upon it, on each side of the river, is
a cluster of four cast-iron pillars, about 33 feet high.&nbsp;
The bridge is 23 feet above the ordinary level of the river, and
altogether it consists of about 50 tons of iron, the whole of
which was wrought on the ground, and the bridge finished in about
three months.&nbsp; Its cost was 850<i>l.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp; When
Mr. Gerrard <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>first projected the Queen&rsquo;s Park, he saw at once
the necessity of providing a shorter and better pathway to the
city than the old route through Handbridge, and the erection of
Queen&rsquo;s Park Suspension Bridge was therefore the starting
point of his building operations.&nbsp; Nor has the result belied
his confident anticipations of the popularity of the Park; for
what was, but a year or two ago, a modest agricultural farm, is
now fast developing into an important and delightful
suburb.&nbsp; In fact, the salubrity of the air, and the high
commanding situation of Queen&rsquo;s Park, together with its
beautiful river scenery, and its close proximity to the city,
combine to render it peculiarly suitable for villa
residences.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To our left are some handsome houses, overlooking the river;
and behind them, the lofty steeple of <span class="smcap">St.
John&rsquo;s Church</span> attracts our especial notice and
admiration.&nbsp; This Church is one of our many Chester lions;
but, as we shall have to deal with it more at large by and bye,
we will pass on now, between some obtrusive houses blocking up
the view on one side, and most prolific gardens and orchards on
the other, until we reach some modern steps on our left, leading
down to the <span class="smcap">Newgate</span>.</p>
<p>This Gate, or its predecessor, was called <i>Wolfeld</i> or
<i>Wolfgate</i>, as also <i>Pepper Gate</i>, from its standing at
the bottom of the Pepper Street.&nbsp; Tradition informs us that
this Gate was &ldquo;of old time closed up and shut, because a
young man stole away a Mayor of Chester&rsquo;s daughter through
the same Gate, as she was playing at ball with other maidens in
the Pepper Street.&rdquo;&nbsp; Albert Smith, in his
&ldquo;Struggles and Adventures of Christopher Tadpole,&rdquo;
perpetuates this tradition, in his own happy and humorous
style.&nbsp; <i>There</i> &lsquo;all who run may read&rsquo; of
the sinful conduct of that wicked young man, and of that almost
as froward and faulty young maiden, whose mutual frailties gave
birth to the Cheshire proverb, &ldquo;When the daughter is
stolen, shut the Pepper Gate,&rdquo;&mdash;another version of
&ldquo;When the steed is stolen, lock the stable door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three paces onwards bring us to some pretty little
gardens on one side, and on the other to the remains of an old
turret, formerly known as <i>Thimbleby&rsquo;s Tower</i>, though
why or wherefore so designated is, &lsquo;in these latter
days,&rsquo; a mystery.&nbsp; Beyond this is a flight of steps,
leading down to the <span class="smcap">Wesleyan Methodist
Chapel</span>, a commodious structure erected in 1811, the
principal front of which is towards St. John&rsquo;s Street; to
the left of it is the School-room of the same religious
community.&nbsp; Within a short distance from this, we mount some
half dozen steps, and find ourselves on the top of the <span
class="smcap">East Gate</span>, and enjoying a view of <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>the principal
Street of the city, at an altitude of some forty feet.&nbsp; At
our back is Foregate Street, the old-fashioned mail-coach road to
Birmingham and London; while in front we have Eastgate Street,
the Cross, and St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, which will receive more
particular attention in our next chapter.</p>
<p>Stepping down from the Eastgate on its opposite side, we have
now completed our circuit of the Walls; and our appetite being
somewhat sharpened by our long walk, we will turn into the
&ldquo;Blossoms,&rdquo; and discuss the merits of such
&ldquo;savoury meats&rdquo; as &ldquo;mine host of that
ilk&rdquo; is enabled to lay before us.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> adequately &ldquo;refreshed
the inner man,&rdquo; we will now, like Don Quixote, sally forth
into the <span class="smcap">Street</span> &ldquo;in search of
the picturesque,&rdquo; and doubtless we shall there find much of
a nature to interest and delight us.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Eastgate</span>, under which we are
now passing, marks the termination of the old Watling
Street,&mdash;the line of which is here taken up by the chief of
the four great Streets of the city, as planned and excavated by
the soldier colonists of once mighty Rome.&nbsp; We have passed
from Foregate into <span class="smcap">Eastgate Street</span>,
ever the <i>via principalis</i> of Chester, and still maintaining
that ancient prerogative despite the revolutionary inroads of
steam.&nbsp; It is the one great highway for all passengers and
conveyances to and from the Station, and as a necessary
consequence holds the proud distinction of being, for all
business purposes, the main Street of the city.</p>
<p>This arcade on our left is the <i>Royal Hotel Row</i>, and the
massive pile of buildings of which it forms a part, and from
which it derives its name, is the <span class="smcap">Royal
Hotel</span>.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; is pre-eminently the
chief Hotel of the city; for besides being the most central and
commodious, it is at the same time <i>par excellence</i> the
first and most fashionable of all our Chester Hotels, and under
its present efficient management, is certainly not surpassed by
any similar provincial establishment.&nbsp; Its capacious
<i>Assembly Room</i> is, with perhaps one exception, the finest
room the city can boast, and is consequently in high repute for
all literary and <a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>musical entertainments.&nbsp; The Royal Hotel enjoys the
singular felicity of being <i>in three distinct parishes</i>;
thus, in a religious, as well as a commercial point of view,
&ldquo;it stands well!&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p44b.jpg">

</a></p>
<p>If you have any curiosity for modern ruins, turn up this
passage in front of the Hotel, and see the baneful effects of a
chancery suit on what was once a flourishing mart of commerce;
and as you look upon that half roofless, tottering fabric, still
known as the <i>Manchester Hall</i>, &ldquo;thank your propitious
stars&rdquo; that you, at least, are free from the trammels of
the law.</p>
<p>The street immediately beyond on the left, is <span
class="smcap">Newgate Street</span>, anciently styled
<i>Fleshmonger Lane</i>, from its having been at one time the
chief place of business of the butchers.&nbsp; Nearly opposite to
it, on the right hand, is <span class="smcap">St. Werburgh
Street</span>, which we shall notice by and bye, when we pay our
visit to the Cathedral.</p>
<p>And here we are introduced to another unique characteristic of
old Chester,&mdash;its venerable Rows.&nbsp; To account
satisfactorily for the origin of these Rows, is a problem which
has troubled far brighter heads than ours; and, indeed, all we
know in the present <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>day is, that in reality we <i>know nothing</i> of their
earliest history.&nbsp; Some writers, with exuberant fancies,
have attributed to the Rows a British foundation: while others,
with greater apparent reason, consider them a vestige of the
dominion of Rome, and to have been by them erected, conjointly
for the purposes of recreation and defence.&nbsp; There are many
circumstances which seem to justify this view of the case;
particularly that of their resemblance to the porticoes or
<i>vestibula</i> spoken of by Plautus and other Latin
authors.&nbsp; Further confirmatory of their Roman origin, we may
add that there is, or was, a street in old Rome, bearing a close
analogy to the Rows of Chester.&nbsp; Taking into account also
that a Roman Bath and Lavatory exist to this very hour under one
of these Rows, the arguments in favour of their Roman creation
are certainly entitled to a fair amount of weight.</p>
<p>If it be difficult to arrive at the early history of these
Rows, equally difficult is it to attempt to describe them to a
stranger.&nbsp; Distrusting our own powers, we will call in the
aid of our friend Albert Smith, who in describing the Rows of
what he calls &ldquo;this marvellous city,&rdquo; proceeds to say
that &ldquo;the passenger&rsquo;s footway lies right through the
first floor fronts of the houses&mdash;which are cleared away
altogether, and above the shop, of ordinary normal position, by
the road-side; and thus, the back drawing-rooms, or whatever else
they may be, are turned into more shops; and great is the puzzle
of the stranger as to whether the roadway is down in the cellar,
or he is up stairs on the landing, or the house has turned itself
out of window; affording a literal proof of that curious state of
domestic affairs so often spoken of.&nbsp; And first he fancies
the &lsquo;Row&rsquo;&mdash;as it is termed&mdash;is like the
Quadrant, with the road excavated a floor lower, and shops made
under the pavement; and then it reminds him of a Thames-side
tavern, with all the shutter wainscots, that divide the large
convivial room into so many little philandering ones, drawn away,
and the windows knocked out.&nbsp; And finally he arrives at the
conclusion that there is nothing else in the world at all like
it, except the prints published by the enterprising booksellers
who live there.&nbsp; But very convenient is this arrangement for
old ladies of weak minds who quail at meeting cattle; and young
ladies of extravagant ones who doat on shopping, in spite of the
weather.&nbsp; For it raises the first above suspicion even of
danger; and shelters the second from being favoured with the
visits of the clouds, who cannot here drop in upon
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Another
description from the pen of an American, is still more
intelligible.&nbsp; Writing to a friend on the other side of the
Atlantic, he says, &ldquo;The second story of most of the houses
is thrown forward, as you have seen it in the old settlers&rsquo;
houses at home.&nbsp; Sometimes it projects several feet, and is
supported by posts in the sidewalk.&nbsp; Soon this becomes a
frequent and then a continuous arrangement; the posts are
generally of stone, forming an arcade,&mdash;and you walk beneath
them in the shade.&nbsp; Sometimes, instead of posts, a solid
wall supports the house above.&nbsp; You observe, as would be
likely in an old city, that the surface is irregular, that we are
ascending a slight elevation.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the old
structure overhead, and the well-worn flagging under foot, we
notice the shop fronts are filled with plate-glass, and with all
the brilliancy of the most modern art and taste.&nbsp; Turning,
to make the contrast more striking, by looking at the little
windows and rude carvings of the houses opposite, we see a
banister or handrail separates the side-walk from the carriage
way, and are astonished, in stepping out to it, to find the
street is some ten feet below us.&nbsp; We are evidently on the
second floor of the houses.&nbsp; Finding steps leading down we
descend into the street, and discover another tier of shops, on
the roofs of which we have been walking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And now for our own brief sketch of the Streets and
Rows.&nbsp; This house, near by, with the eccentric gable, and
grotesquely carved front is the notable establishment of Messrs.
Platt and Son, chemists.&nbsp; The shop itself, which is one of
the most chaste and elegant in the city, deserves something more
than a mere passing notice, and is worthy the careful inspection
of every true &lsquo;lover of the beautiful.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;This shop,&rdquo; says the <i>Chester Courant</i>,
&ldquo;exhibits one of the most perfect and beautiful examples of
the application of architectural and artistic skill and taste to
the purposes of business, that we have lately witnessed.&nbsp; It
is the joint work of Mr. Penson and Mr. J. Morris, whose combined
talents in the constructive and decorative departments, have
produced a most successful and elegant illustration of the manner
in which the antique character of our domestic architecture can
be preserved, with every regard for modern requirements and
comforts.&nbsp; The wood-work has been well executed by Mr.
Hankey; the floor is paved with fancy tiles from the celebrated
manufactory of Messrs. Minton, in Staffordshire; and all the
details and fittings of the establishment have been carried out
with characteristic taste and propriety.&nbsp; We should hope
that the good sense <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>and intelligence, as well as public spirit, displayed by
Mr. Platt in this judicious work of restoration, will give an
impulse to other improvements in the right direction; while at
the same time it excites a regret that alterations have been
previously effected, in such utter disregard of the architecture
of the Rows, seeing how beautifully their original appearance
might have been preserved, to maintain the unique characteristic
of the old city.&rdquo;&nbsp; The hope indulged in this last
paragraph has not &ldquo;wasted <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>its fragrance on the desert
air,&rdquo; as two neighbouring erections sufficiently
testify.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Next door to Messrs. Platt&rsquo;s, and half hidden by the
shop which obstructs it just in front, is that favourite resort
of the fair sex, the drapery establishment of the Messrs.
McLellan.&nbsp; A few yards farther up the street, our eye rests
on the gabled <i>fa&ccedil;ade</i>, and handsome shop front of
Mr. Bolland, Confectioner, Bride Cake Manufacturer to her Majesty
the Queen.&nbsp; What! you are about <a name="page49"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 49</span>to get married, are you?&nbsp; Well
then, &ldquo;a word to the wise is sufficient for
them,&rdquo;&mdash;give an order to Mr. Bolland for a Chester
Bride Cake, and tell him it must be of the quality once supplied
to Queen Victoria, and you&rsquo;ll never forget this
&ldquo;sweet and luscious reminiscence&rdquo; of your approaching
wedding-day.</p>

<p>You will perceive that there is a covered Row also on the
other side of this street, similar in character, though not in
adornment, to the one we have just been noticing.&nbsp; This is
popularly known as the <i>Pepper Alley Row</i>, a quaint but
gloomy looking region, rendered still more so by the projecting
block of buildings displayed in our engraving.&nbsp; Here are the
well known drapery establishments of Messrs. Oakes, and Ambrose
Williams, and that curious old zigzag erection, occupied by Mr.
Hill, Chester&rsquo;s enterprising boot-maker: behind which
premises <i>Pepper Alley Row</i> &ldquo;worms its darksome
way&rdquo; into Northgate Street.&nbsp; In this Row are the rooms
<a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>of the
<i>Church of England Educational Institute</i>, and the Chester
<span class="smcap">Excise Office</span>.</p>
<p>On the ground floor of Messrs. Prichard and Dodd&rsquo;s
carpet warehouse in Eastgate Street, there is a curious and
interesting old crypt, erected, it is supposed, in the eighth
century, an illustration of which will be found in our
advertising sheet.</p>
<p>We are now fairly arrived at the <span class="smcap">High
Cross</span>, and close to the spot where that sacred emblem of
the faith in old time stood.&nbsp; This ancient landmark, which
was of stone, and elaborately carved, had for centuries
ornamented this part of the city, and was a relic much and
deservedly prized by the citizens.&nbsp; The Puritans, however,
on obtaining possession of the city in 1646, with their
characteristic abhorrence of the beautiful, and in direct breach
of the articles of surrender, demolished this &ldquo;fayre
crosse.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No cross, no crown&rdquo; was, in a
perverted sense, the motto of these fanatics, whose &ldquo;organs
of destructiveness&rdquo; must, beyond doubt, have been largely
developed.&nbsp; Some fragments of the Cross were picked up at
the time, and hidden within the porch of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church
hard by, where a century or so afterwards they were discovered,
and now ornament the grounds of Netherlegh House, near this
city.</p>
<p>Near the Cross was the <span class="smcap">Conduit</span>, to
which water was of old brought in pipes to this city from St.
Giles&rsquo; Well in Boughton, and this conduit it was that,
according to ancient records, was made to &ldquo;run with
wine&rdquo; on all public and festive occasions.&nbsp; Here also,
upon the south side of St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, was the
Penthouse or <i>Pentice</i> of the city, where the mayor and
magistrates of the old regime sat to administer justice with the
one hand, and feed on turtle with the other.&nbsp; A <i>lean</i>
alderman was as great a curiosity in those days, as a <i>fat</i>
parish pauper would be deemed in the present.&nbsp; The Pentice,
which, with its accessories the Stocks and the Pillory, had too
long obstructed this quarter of the city, was pulled down in
1803, and its jurisdiction removed to a more commodious room in
the north end of the Exchange.</p>
<p>This locality, crowded as it must have been before the removal
of these obstructions, was also annually the scene of the
<i>Corporation Bullbait</i>, thus vividly described by Cowdroy, a
local scribe of the last century: &ldquo;The Cross is famous for
being the annual scene of exhibition of that <i>polite play</i>
called a bull-bait; where four or five of these <i>horned
heroes</i> are attended by several hundred lovers of that
<i>rational amusement</i>.&nbsp; Till within a few years the
<i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> of this <i>elegant scene</i>
included even magistracy <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>itself, the mayor and corporation
attending in their official habiliments, at the Pentice windows,
not only to countenance the <i>diversions</i> of the <i>ring</i>,
but to participate in a sight of its <i>enjoyments</i>.&nbsp; A
proclamation was also made by the crier of the court, with all
the gravity and solemnity of an oration before a <i>Romish
sacrifice</i>; the elegant composition of which runs thus,
&lsquo;<i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp; <i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp; <i>Oyez</i>!&nbsp;
<i>If any man stands within twenty yards of the bull-ring</i>,
<i>let him take</i>&mdash;<i>what comes</i>.&rsquo;&nbsp; After
which followed the usual public ejaculations, for the safety of
the king, and the mayor of the city;&rdquo; when the
<i>beauties</i> of the scene commenced, and the dogs immediately
<i>fell to</i>.&nbsp; Here a prayer for his worship was not
unseasonable, as even the ermined cloak was no security against
the carcases of dead animals, with which spectators, without
distinction, were occasionally saluted.&nbsp; In many ancient
boroughs a law formerly prevailed, that no bulls should be
slaughtered for food without having been first thus baited by
dogs.&nbsp; They loved tender beefsteaks in those days!</p>
<p>This barbarous recreation of a bygone age has long since been
put down by the strong arm of the law, and we can now from the
very spot study the character of yonder Row, which commanded in
those days so near a view of the revolting spectacle.</p>
<p>The ancient and the modern in domestic architecture here stand
forth in curious juxtaposition.&nbsp; To the left rests a
building of venerable mien, the builder of which flourished
probably in the sixteenth century, when Harry the Eighth or
Elizabeth swayed the sceptre of England, and when wood and
plaster was the chief ingredient in houses of this
description.</p>
<p>In the centre of our view, looking affably down on its
two-gabled neighbour, is a bold and substantial building of white
freestone, erected in 1837, on the site of an older and more
picturesque house.&nbsp; This is the business retreat of <i>our
publisher</i>, and by the same token the oldest book
establishment in the city.&nbsp; Here are procurable, in almost
endless variety, Guides to Chester and North Wales, local prints,
books of views, &amp;c. to suit every imaginable taste and
requirement.&nbsp; Perhaps no city in the empire has been so
fully and faithfully illustrated as Chester,&mdash;Prout, Cuitt,
Pickering, Sumners, and others equally celebrated in the walks of
art, have plied their pencils in its honour, while the genius of
the engraver and the enterprise of the publisher have given
permanence to their works.</p>
<p>The other house depicted upon the right of our view, its front
bearing the arms of the Apothecaries&rsquo; Company, is the
well-known establishment of <span class="smcap">Mr. J. D.
Farrer</span>, Chemist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farrer&rsquo;s Cestrian <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>Bouquet&rdquo; and &ldquo;Floral Extract&rdquo; are
perfumes too well known to the fair <i>&eacute;lite</i> of
Chester to need more than a passing notice here.&nbsp; Strangers
and visitors, however, will thank us for the hint that these, and
other like gems of the toilet, fragrant mementos of &ldquo;rare
old Chester,&rdquo; are &ldquo;prepared and sold only by Mr.
Farrer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Opposite to these premises stands the parish <span
class="smcap">Church of St. Peter</span>, the site of which is
supposed to have been also that of the Roman
<i>Pr&oelig;torium</i>.&nbsp; Tradition ascribes the first
building of this church to that Mercian celebrity, the Countess
Ethelfleda, who raised an edifice in the centre of the city to
the mutual honour of St. Peter and St. Paul.&nbsp; These two
saints had, up to that time, presided over the destinies of the
mother church of Chester, now the Cathedral, but a &lsquo;new
light&rsquo; having sprung up in the person of the virgin-wife,
St. Werburgh, the two aforesaid apostles were relieved of their
charge, and a new Church erected and dedicated to them on the
spot we are now surveying.&nbsp; Bradshaw the monk, from <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>whose quaint
historic poem we have already quoted, thus records the
translation:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And the olde churche of Peter and of Paule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By a generall counsell of the spiritualte,<br />
With helpe of the Duke moost principall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was translate to the myddes of the sayd cite,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where a paresshe churche was edified truele<br />
In honour of the aforesaid apostoles twayne,<br />
Whiche shall for ever by grace divine remayne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Paul&rsquo;s connection with the church appears to have
ceased before the Conquest, since which time the edifice has been
once or twice rebuilt.&nbsp; The spire is recorded to have been
re-edified in 1479, in which year the <i>parson of the
parish</i>, with his officers, ate a goose upon the top, and cast
the well-picked bones into the four streets below.&nbsp; The
ecclesiastics of those days were a jovial crew,&mdash;none of
your lean, skewery-built men, like their degenerate types of the
present day,&mdash;but priests of size and substance; men who
quaffed their wine and sack right merrily; and who evidently
looked after the <i>spirits</i> of their flocks more than after
their souls.&nbsp; Must not those have been &ldquo;good old
times!&rdquo;&nbsp; The east and part of the south sides of the
church were rebuilt in 1640, just before the breaking out of the
great Civil War.&nbsp; The &ldquo;parson and goose spire&rdquo;
having been injured by lightning in 1780, was that same year
removed.&nbsp; The present square steeple was rebuilt in 1813;
and the illuminated clock which ornaments the south front was
first publicly lit up in 1835.&nbsp; The interior of the church,
which contains some venerable monuments, has of late years been
considerably improved and beautified.</p>

of Chester.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Westward</span>, ho! a few steps, and we
find ourselves moving along Watergate Street; once, and when
Chester was a thriving port, the chief street of the city.&nbsp;
As with men, so</p>
<blockquote><p>There is a tide in the affairs of
<i>streets</i>,<br />
Which taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but the tide for Watergate Street has ebbed away, and now
flows in other and more favoured channels.&nbsp; Still, as we
shall presently see, this Street is not behind any of its
neighbours in absorbing interest.&nbsp; You will perceive that,
like Eastgate Street, it has the Cestrian characteristic on
either side,&mdash;its high-level Row.&nbsp; The one upon the
right hand, adjoining St. Peter&rsquo;s Church, is, perhaps, as
good a specimen as we have now left to us of the
&ldquo;Rows&rdquo; of the last century.&nbsp; Had we the time to
spare, a ramble along this Row, and a hole-and-corner visit to
the numerous alleys that intersect it, would convince the most
sceptical that there is more in Chester than meets the eye.&nbsp;
But we must away,&mdash;for see! here is an odd-looking tenement,
on the other side the street, inviting our attention.&nbsp; Two
hundred years ago that house was in the pride of youth, and the
residence of a family of &ldquo;some rank and standing,&rdquo; as
is evidenced by the armorial bearings carved on one of the beams;
but, as somebody or other (Longfellow, we believe), has justly
enough observed, &ldquo;it is not always May!&rdquo;, in proof of
which this house has of late years been occupied as a sausage
shop, and now shelters the defenceless head of a barber.&nbsp;
Small and low are the rooms of this house&mdash;absurdly so to
the critic of the present generation; and so contracted is the
ceiling of the Row at this point, that no man of ordinary stature
can pass along without stooping.&nbsp; Is it not a quaint old
spot?&nbsp; Look up <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>at yon inscription on the cross-beam.&nbsp; Tradition
avers that this house was the only one in the city that escaped
the plague, which ravaged the city during the seventeenth
century.&nbsp; In gratitude for that deliverance, the owner of
the house is said to have carved upon the front the words we are
now reading&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">1652.&nbsp; <span
class="smcap">God&rsquo;s providence is mine
inheritance</span>.&nbsp; 1652.</p>

</a></p>
<p>On the right hand, lower down, is <span class="smcap">Goss
Street</span>; and still lower, <span class="smcap">Crook
Street</span>, both destitute of interest to sight-seers: but, <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>exactly
opposite to Crook Street, stand three fine gable-fronted houses,
the centre one of which deserves our attention and
admiration.&nbsp; This house is, without exception, the most
curious and remarkable of its kind in Chester, and one which,
perhaps, has no parallel in Great Britain.&nbsp; Prout has
immortalised it in one of his inimitable sketches, of which the
accompanying woodcut is a reduced, yet faithful copy.&nbsp; The
origin of the house seems to be lost in fable; but, in the
present day, it is usually styled <span class="smcap">Bishop
Lloyd&rsquo;s House</span>, from the fact of that Cestrian
prelate dying about the date (1615,) carved on one of the panels,
and from certain coats-of-arms <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>which decorate the front, bearing
some analogy to the bearings of his family.&nbsp; Grotesquely
carved from the apex of the gable to the very level of the Row,
this house exhibits a profusion of ornament, and an eccentricity
of design, unattempted in any structure of the kind within our
knowledge.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a unique and magnificent work of
art.&nbsp; To say nothing of the designs in the higher
compartments, it must suffice here to state, that the subjects of
the lower panels lay the plan of human redemption prominently
before the eye.&nbsp; In the first panel, we have Adam and Eve in
Paradise, in a state of sinless nudity; then comes the first
great consequence of the Fall, Cain murdering Abel his
brother.&nbsp; To this follows Abraham offering up his Son Isaac;
typical of the &ldquo;one great Sacrifice for us
all.&rdquo;&nbsp; The seventh compartment has a curious
representation of the Immaculate Conception, whereby
&ldquo;Christ Jesus came into the world to save
sinners.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ridiculous have been some of the attempts
of &ldquo;Local Guide-makers&rdquo; to arrive at the real meaning
of this design: some have gravely set it down as the
&ldquo;Flight into Egypt;&rdquo; while another and later
&ldquo;unfortunate&rdquo; has sapiently pronounced it to be
&ldquo;Susannah and the Elders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The eighth panel
symbolises the completion of the great sacrifice, the Crucifixion
of Christ, in Simeon&rsquo;s prophecy to the
Virgin,&mdash;&ldquo;Yea, a sword shall pierce through thine own
heart also.&rdquo;&nbsp; The three centre compartments contain
the arms of the reigning monarch, James I., England&rsquo;s
Solomon, as he was called,&mdash;the supposed arms and
quarterings of Bishop Lloyd,&mdash;and a Latin inscription, with
the date 1615.&nbsp; If it be true that</p>
<blockquote><p>A thing of beauty is a joy for ever,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>then will this house, as a masterpiece of art, be an object of
interest and delight to strangers, &ldquo;till time itself shall
be no more.&rdquo;&nbsp; We should step up into the Row at this
point, and scrutinise the indescribable forms of men and beasts
which ornament and support the oaken pillars in front.</p>

</a></p>
<p>A few steps lower down the Row is a passage or alley,
communicating with Commonhall Street, called <i>Puppet Show
Entry</i>.&nbsp; This passage is chiefly memorable as the scene
of a most terrific explosion, which shook the city like an
earthquake, on the anniversary of the Gunpowder Plot, November
5th, 1772.&nbsp; A large room in this passage was fitted up as a
sort of Marionette Theatre,&mdash;a large audience had
assembled,&mdash;the puppets were going through their strange
evolutions,&mdash;when, by some appalling <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>misfortune,
eight hundred-weight of gunpowder lodged in a warehouse below
suddenly blew up with a tremendous report, killing the showman
and twenty-two others; eighty-three, besides, being more or less
seriously injured.&nbsp; In remembrance of that fearful calamity,
this alley has been ever since known as the <i>Puppet Show
Entry</i>.</p>
<p>Where that new range of superior houses now stands, on the
opposite side of the street, was, until very recently, a fine old
mansion of wood and plaster, the city residence of the
Mainwarings, a notable Cheshire family.</p>
<p>Just below we have, upon the left hand, <span
class="smcap">Weaver Street</span>, anciently <i>St.
Alban&rsquo;s Lane</i>, leading to the spot where the Church and
<i>Monastery of the White Friars</i> in times past stood.&nbsp;
Of this monastic establishment no vestige remains, except a
portion of the western wall, which is still visible from Weaver
Street.&nbsp; The spire of this Church, which was of noble
dimensions, served mariners as a landmark in steering their
vessels up to the Walls of Chester.</p>
<p>On the right side of Watergate Street is <span
class="smcap">Trinity Street</span>, in which is the oldest
dissenting chapel in the city.&nbsp; It was erected in 1700, by
the followers and friends of <span class="smcap">Matthew
Henry</span>, the nonconformist, a learned and earnest preacher
of his day, and author of the celebrated &ldquo;Commentary on the
Holy Scriptures&rdquo; which bears his name.</p>
<p>Passing Trinity Street, we arrive at the Parish <span
class="smcap">Church</span> of the <span class="smcap">Holy and
Undivided Trinity</span>, the first foundation of which is lost
in remote obscurity.&nbsp; So early as the year 1188, we find
Walter, rector of this Church, witnessing a deed relating to the
Church of Rostherne, in this county.&nbsp; Very little, if any,
of the original Church now exists; the west side is, perhaps, the
most ancient portion of the structure, as it at present
stands.&nbsp; Prior to 1811, the steeple was surmounted by a
handsome spire, which, proving on examination to be in a
dilapidated state, was pulled down, and the present square tower
substituted.&nbsp; The reason for this change is not very
obvious; perhaps there may have been bickerings and dissensions
in the vestry as to the relative cost of the two, and the
authorities thought it best to give up the <i>point</i>, in order
to make matters <i>square</i>.&nbsp; The advowson of the Church
is vested in the Earl of Derby, having previously belonged to the
Norman barony of Montalt, one of the titles created by Hugh
Lupus, Earl of Chester.</p>
<p>The interior is worthy the inspection of the curious.&nbsp;
Near the south-west entrance is the baptismal font, by the side
of which <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>lies the defaced effigy of a mail-clad knight, Sir John
Whitmore by name, representative in the reign of Edward III. of
the Whitmores of Thurstaston, a Cheshire family of knightly
lineage and renown.&nbsp; This monument was discovered in 1853,
under a pew at the south-west end; the face, hands, and knees,
having been barbarously cut away, to suit the flooring of the
pew.&nbsp; In its perfect state, the monument must have been one
of the purest symmetry and beauty, and was evidently the work of
an eminent sculptor, the Westmacott or Gibson of his day.&nbsp;
The legend runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Hic jacet Ioannes de
Whitmore, qui obiit 3 kal.&nbsp; Octob. A.D. 1374.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A brass plate on the south side of the altar commemorates the
burial of <span class="smcap">Matthew Henry</span>, June 22nd,
1714.&nbsp; He who had during life been a rigid nonconformist, at
the &ldquo;last sad scene of all&rdquo; conformed to the faith of
his forefathers, and lies interred in the chancel of that parish
in which he had so long ministered as a dissenter.</p>
<p>The bones of another celebrity &ldquo;lie mouldering
here,&rdquo;&mdash;Dr. Parnell, the poet, Archdeacon of Clogher,
who was buried in this Church, October 23, 1718.&nbsp; Other
monuments of interest ornament (or shall we rather say
<i>deface</i>?) the pillars and chancel walls.&nbsp; In one of
the western windows are some remnants of ancient stained glass,
and an obituary memorial, of chaste design, has of late years
been put up in one of the small east windows of St.
Patrick&rsquo;s aisle.</p>
<p>A good view of Trinity Church is obtained from the end of
Nicholas Street, just opposite to that ancient hostelry, the
<span class="smcap">Yacht Inn</span>.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Yacht</span> is, without exception, the most
picturesque and curious of all our Chester inns.&nbsp; Time was
when it was the first hotel of the city, and even now,
&ldquo;grown grey with long and faithful service,&rdquo; lacks
nothing that can render it a fit home for the wayfarer, whom
chance or design has brought to the old city.&nbsp; Americans,
who lust after the ancient and venerable, and who delight in the
rare timber houses of old England, will do well to select snug
apartments at the <i>Yacht</i>, for its host, Mr. White, is the
very impersonation of a true British Boniface.&nbsp; But the
<i>Yacht</i>, apart altogether from the qualities of &ldquo;mine
host,&rdquo; and his well-filled cellar of &ldquo;Huxley&rsquo;s
Fine,&rdquo; has other claims upon our attention.&nbsp; It was at
this house, then in the zenith of its glory, that the eccentric
and witty Dean Swift (who has not read his
&ldquo;Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels?&rdquo;) stayed, on one of his
journeys into <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>Ireland.&nbsp; The Dean, being of a convivial turn,
invited the dignitaries of the Cathedral to a supper at the
<i>Yacht</i>, but to his great mortification not one of them
appeared.&nbsp; Disgusted at this return to his hospitality, the
Dean scratched with his diamond ring on one of the windows of
this house the following distich, not over complimentary to the
church or the city,&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Rotten without and mouldering within,<br />
This place and its clergy are both near akin!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So much for the <i>Yacht</i>.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Custom House</span>, immediately opposite, with its
low stuccoed front, has nothing to arrest the special notice of
visitors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nicholas Street</span>, which branches off
in a direct line towards the Castle, has on the right hand a
terrace of well-built, first-class houses, extending as far as
the corner of <i>Grey Friars</i>.&nbsp; From the circumstance of
every alternate house in this terrace being occupied <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>by a doctor,
it has latterly acquired the appropriate cognomen of <i>Pill-box
Promenade</i>!</p>
<p>Some distance up Nicholas Street, on the left hand, is <span
class="smcap">St. Martin&rsquo;s Church</span>, a humble brick
building, erected in 1721, in the place of an older structure
dating back to the thirteenth century.&nbsp; St. Martin&rsquo;s
parish has recently been united to that of St. Bridget, and the
services of this Church are now, in consequence,
discontinued.</p>
<p>Moving along <i>St. Martin&rsquo;s Ash</i>, as this locality
is termed, past <i>Cuppin Street</i>, where the Old Gas Works are
situate, we obtain a good front view of the new Church of <span
class="smcap">St. Bridget</span>.&nbsp; This Church, or rather
its predecessor, stood originally at the other end of <span
class="smcap">Grosvenor Street</span>, immediately opposite to
St. Michael&rsquo;s Church, and its foundation has been by some
ascribed to Offa, King of Mercia, in the eighth century.&nbsp; Be
this as it may, there are records preserved which establish its
existence at least as early as the year 1200.&nbsp; On the
erection of the <i>Grosvenor Bridge</i>, it was found that this
Church stood exactly in the track of the projected New Road, now
called <span class="smcap">Grosvenor Street</span>, and an act of
parliament was consequently obtained for its removal.&nbsp; The
old Church was demolished in 1827, and the grave-stones and
bodies removed, where practicable, to the new burial-ground
adjoining the present Church.&nbsp; The first stone of the new
edifice was laid October 12, 1827, by Dr. C. J. Blomfield, the
present Bishop of London, who at that time presided over the see
of Chester.&nbsp; This structure presents outwardly none of the
characteristics of a Christian Church; and might easily be
mistaken for some pagan temple, rather than for one dedicated to
the worship of the Most High.</p>
<p>Returning to Watergate Street, we see before us <span
class="smcap">Linen Hall Street</span>, called formerly <i>Lower
Lane</i>, from its being at one time the last street on this side
of the city.&nbsp; There is nothing to interest us in this
street, which terminates with <i>St. Martin&rsquo;s in the
Fields</i>, at the rear of the Gaol, and General Infirmary.&nbsp;
So late as the sixteenth century, there was at the further end of
this street an ancient Church, quoted in old deeds as the
<i>Church of St. Chad</i>, but the place thereof is now nowhere
to be found.</p>
<p>Lower still down Watergate Street, is <span
class="smcap">Linen Hall Place</span>, where the Chester <span
class="smcap">Chess Club</span> holds its meetings, and where
players of every country and clime are sure of a hearty and
welcome reception.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite to this Place, up a narrow, inconvenient <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>passage, is a
house which invites and eminently deserves our notice and
admiration.&nbsp; This house is styled indifferently the <span
class="smcap">Old Palace</span>, and <span class="smcap">Stanley
House</span>, from its having been originally the city palace or
residence of the Stanleys of Alderley, a family of note in the
county, and now ennobled.&nbsp; This is an elaborately carved,
three-gabled house, and is perhaps the oldest unmutilated
specimen of a timber house remaining in the city, the date of its
erection being carved on the front,&mdash;1591.&nbsp; The sombre
dignity of its exterior pervades also the internal construction
of this house,&mdash;the large rooms, the panelled walls, the
oaken <a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>floors, the massive staircase, all pointing it out as
the abode of aristocracy in the olden time.</p>

</a></p>
<p>From hence to the <span class="smcap">Watergate</span> is
little more than a stone&rsquo;s throw; but on the left is the
handsome city residence of H. Potts, Esq., representative of a
family long and honourably connected with the county.&nbsp; This
house and the locality round occupy the site of the ancient
<i>Monastery of the Black Friars</i>, where the black-cowled
faithful &lsquo;fasted and prayed&rsquo; down to the period of
the Dissolution, but of which scarcely any traces, save the
fragment of a wall, are now discernible.</p>
<p>The passage to the right leads to <span class="smcap">Stanley
Place</span>, near which, in 1779, a Roman Hypocaust, and the
remains of a house, also of the same remote period, were
discovered.&nbsp; Such portions of these remains as escaped the
ruthless pickaxes of the workmen, were removed to Oulton Park,
and now ornament the museum of its present worthy owner, Sir P.
Grey Egerton, Bart., M.P. for the county.</p>
<p>Beyond the Watergate are <span class="smcap">Paradise
Row</span>, overlooking the <span
class="smcap">Roodeye</span>,&mdash;and the two <span
class="smcap">Crane Streets</span>; beyond which we are
introduced to that fabulous existence of modern days,&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Port</span> of Chester.&nbsp; Time was when
we might have tuned our harps to a different key, but now, alas!
we can only lament the fallen condition of our ancient port, and
the wretched indifference of those &lsquo;high in
authority,&rsquo; who by their senseless apathy in past days have
brought the maritime trade of Chester to its present lifeless and
ignominious state.&nbsp; This is a sore subject; so we will at
once retrace our steps to the Cross, and in the next chapter
continue our perambulations through the city.</p>

Mary&rsquo;s Church.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Heigho</span>!&nbsp; After our bootless
lamentation over the deceased Port of Chester, it is refreshing
to return once more to an atmosphere of life and activity.</p>
<p>Turning our faces towards the south, we have before us <span
class="smcap">Bridge Street</span>, another of the four great
Roman roads of the city.&nbsp; Here again we see the
Rows,&mdash;those strange old Rows!&mdash;threading their
tubelike course along both sides of the Street.&nbsp; The one
upon the right hand is called the <i>Scotch Row</i>, from the
merchants north of the Tweed &lsquo;clanning&rsquo; together
there, during the two great <span class="smcap">Fairs</span>,
held annually at Chester from time immemorial.&nbsp; It should be
remembered that, except at these privileged times, none but
freemen were permitted to trade within the city; whence is to be
attributed the large concourse of foreign tradesmen to these once
important Fairs.&nbsp; Since the downfall of this monopoly, the
<i>Scotch Row</i> has become a desert wilderness, so far as
business is concerned; but it will still serve as an admirable
index to the stranger of what the Rows of Chester were a hundred
years ago.&nbsp; The street fronts of the houses in this Row are
more than ordinarily diversified,&mdash;the square red brick, the
everlasting gable of every shape and size, the stately
bow-window, and the ponderous, overhanging Dutch fronts, all
flaunting their pretensions within this circumscribed
space.&nbsp; Previous to 1839, no special arch&aelig;ological
interest attached to this locality; but in that year while
excavating for a warehouse behind the shop of Messrs. Powell and
Edwards, cutlers, a discovery was made which at once set all the
antiquaries of Chester &ldquo;by the ears.&rdquo;&nbsp; The late
Rev. J. Eaton, Precentor of the Cathedral, an architectural
authority in his day, made the following Report upon this <span
class="smcap">Ancient Crypt</span>, as it is called, for the use
of the proprietors.&nbsp; <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>To these gentlemen, and particularly
to Mr. Edwards, the representative of the firm, the public are
deeply indebted for their intelligence and courtesy, in not only
preserving intact this relic of the past, but also for so readily
affording admission to the structure:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The lower parts of several of the houses in
the four principal streets of Chester exhibit indubitable signs
that they have been built on the remains of the religious
buildings with which, prior to the Reformation, this city
abounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ancient Crypt discovered by Messrs. Powell and
Edwards is of an oblong form, running from east to west.&nbsp;
The following are its dimensions, viz. length, forty-two feet;
breadth, fifteen feet three inches; height, from the surface of
the floor to the intersection of the groinings of the roof,
fourteen feet.&nbsp; This Crypt was partially lighted through the
upper part of the west end, in which there are three small
windows, divided by stone mullions, and protected by iron
bars.&nbsp; The upper part of the groining on the centre window
appears to have been cut away to admit of more light.&nbsp; On
examining the intersection of the groins, marks were discovered
from the lead on the stone-work, that a couple of lamps had been
used for lighting.&nbsp; The entrance to the east end is by a
flight of steps cut out of the rock to the height of three
feet.&nbsp; On the south side is an Anglo-Norman-Gothic doorway,
which is attained by three or four semicircular steps, and forms
an outlet within its inner and outer wall by another flight of
steps to the surface above the building.&nbsp; In a niche on the
south side of the window is a font in excellent preservation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The architecture is Anglo-Norman-Gothic, and the groins
are of the third class of groining, which came into common use
about the year 1180, and was succeeded in the next class of
groins in the year 1280, so that if we date this roof as being
erected about the year 1230, we shall not be far from the era of
its real construction.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Messrs. Powell and Edwards make no charge for admission: we
must not omit, therefore, ere we pass out from the <i>Crypt</i>,
to drop a stray piece of silver into the hat of the <i>Blue Coat
Boy</i> who stands modestly at the door.&nbsp; Charity is seldom
ill-bestowed; but here we have the special privilege of
contributing, in however slight a degree, to the gratuitous
education of the orphan and the friendless.</p>
<p>The Row upon the left hand is the one most frequented, forming
a junction at right angles with Eastgate Row, before
described.&nbsp; <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>In the sixteenth century this Row was distinguished by
the name of the <i>Mercers&rsquo; Row</i>, from the predominance
here, probably, of that most enticing class of tradesmen.&nbsp;
The love of dress and finery was evidently, even in those days,
woman&rsquo;s chief besetting sin!</p>
<p>A little way down this Row was an ancient tavern, called the
<i>Blue Posts</i>, supposed to be the identical house now
occupied by Mr. Brittain, woollendraper.&nbsp; In this house a
curious incident is stated to have occurred in 1558, which
tradition has handed down to us in the following terms.&nbsp; It
appears that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Dr. Henry Cole, Dean of St. Paul&rsquo;s,
was charged by Queen Mary with a commission to the council of
Ireland, which had for its object the persecution of the Irish
protestants.&nbsp; The doctor stopped one night here on his way
to Dublin, and put up at the <i>Blue Posts</i>, then kept by a
Mrs. Mottershead.&nbsp; In this house he was visited by the
mayor, to whom, in the course of conversation, he related his
errand; in confirmation of which he took from his cloak bag a
leather box, exclaiming in a tone of exultation, &lsquo;Here is
what will lash the heretics of Ireland!&rsquo;&nbsp; This
announcement was caught by the landlady, who had a brother in
Dublin: and while the commissioner was escorting his worship
down-stairs, the good woman, prompted by an affectionate regard
for the safety of her brother, opened the box, took out the
commission, and placed in lieu thereof a pack of cards, with the
<i>knave of clubs</i> uppermost!&nbsp; This the doctor carefully
packed up, without suspecting the transformation; nor was the
deception discovered till his arrival in the presence of the lord
deputy and privy council at the castle of Dublin.&nbsp; The
surprise of the whole assembly, on opening the supposed
commission, may be more easily imagined than described.&nbsp; The
doctor, in short, was immediately sent back for a more
satisfactory authority; but, before he could return to Ireland,
Queen Mary had breathed her last.&nbsp; It should be added that
the ingenuity and affectionate zeal of the landlady were rewarded
by Elizabeth with a pension of &pound;40 a-year.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The first street we meet with on the right hand is <span
class="smcap">Commonhall Street</span>, so called from the
<i>Common Hall</i> of the city having been at one time situate
there.&nbsp; This hall of justice stood upon the south side of
the street, and close to those venerable-looking almshouses still
situate there.&nbsp; It had previously been the <i>Chapel of St.
Ursula</i>, which was founded there, with an <i>Hospital</i> for
decayed persons, by Sir Thomas Smith, in 1532.&nbsp; The Hospital
of St. Ursula still weathers the storm, in those odd-looking,
tottering <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>almshouses on the south side of this street.&nbsp; Lower
down Bridge Street, on the same side, is another break in the
row, formed by <i>Pierpoint Lane</i>, not now a thoroughfare, but
through which went a passage in olden time to the <i>Common
Hall</i>, just referred to.</p>
<p>Scarcely so far down as this last-named lane, and on the
opposite side of Bridge Street, is a new and handsome range of
buildings, erected in 1853 by Mr. Alderman Royle.&nbsp; On the
higher side of these premises, and adjoining the Feathers Hotel,
exist a <span class="smcap">Roman Hypocaust</span> and
<i>Sweating Bath</i>, of surpassing interest, and in a state
almost as perfect as when first erected.&nbsp; The following
account of this &ldquo;ancient of days&rdquo; is the result of a
recent personal visit to the bath.</p>
<p>It consists of two rooms, considerably below the present level
of the street&mdash;the first being fifteen feet long, eight feet
wide, and about six and a half feet deep.&nbsp; The Hypocaust is
of rectangular shape, about the same size, but, except at the
entrance, not more than half as deep as the first chamber.&nbsp;
It was originally supported by thirty-two square pillars, two and
a half feet high, and one foot in diameter at top and bottom:
twenty-eight of these pillars still remain.&nbsp; Brick tiles,
eighteen inches square, and three inches thick, surmount these
pillars; and over these are placed tiles two feet square,
perforated here and there with small holes, through which the
heat ascended to the <i>sweating chamber</i> above.&nbsp; The
sweating room, or Sudatory, was immediately over the Hypocaust,
and was fitted with seats for the bathers, who soon found
themselves in a hot perspiration.&nbsp; They were then scraped
carefully with an instrument constructed for the purpose, or else
plunged into a cold water bath; after which they were rubbed down
with towels, anointed with fresh oil, and then repaired to the
tiring room: there they dressed themselves, deposited their
<i>denarii</i> for the attendants, and then went their way,
having enjoyed a luxury which few but Romans had then learned to
indulge in.</p>
<p>As we have before stated, the buildings above and around have
been only recently rebuilt: but Messrs. Royle, the proprietors,
with that antiquarian zeal, and true public spirit, which have
ever distinguished them, took especial precautions to preserve,
both from injury and molestation, this curious relic of proud old
Rome.&nbsp; Since the adjacent premises have been rebuilt, the
bath is much easier of access than it was before; and visitors
can now inspect these remains without any personal sacrifice,
either of cleanliness or comfort.</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>Lower
down than the Roman Bath, there was, until recently, a break in
this Row, occasioned by a narrow lane, which leads up to the
stables of the Feathers Hotel.&nbsp; This inconvenience has now
been obviated by a neat wooden bridge, stretching across the
passage from row to row; and we can now walk along, without the
slightest obstruction, till we come to St. Michael&rsquo;s
Church.</p>
<p>The large and well-conceived street upon the right hand is
<span class="smcap">Grosvenor Street</span>, capable, under
proper management, of being made the finest street of the
city.&nbsp; It is flanked on the right side by <span
class="smcap">White Friars</span>, formerly <i>Foster&rsquo;s
Lane</i>, in which the Church and Monastery of that fraternity
was at one time situate.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p68b.jpg">
<img alt=

 src="images/p68s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>At the junction of White Friars with Grosvenor Street stands
that capital, well-conducted establishment, the <span
class="smcap">King&rsquo;s Head Inn</span>.&nbsp; This is one of
those quiet, cosy-looking houses, in which, the moment a
traveller enters, he feels himself &ldquo;at home;&rdquo; and <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>certainly,
under the presidency of Mr. and Mrs. Bedson, he will find
that&mdash;&ldquo;deny it who can!&rdquo;&mdash;domestic comforts
are still to be enjoyed in an old English inn.</p>
<p>Some thirty yards up the street, on the right hand, is Cuppin
Street, before noticed; and nearly opposite to it, an old and
narrow street called <i>Bunce Lane</i>, leading off to St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church and the Castle.&nbsp; Beyond, upon the same
side, is an elegant structure of white freestone, erected in
1853, from the designs of Mr. James Harrison, of this city, to
wit, the Chester <span class="smcap">Savings Bank</span>.&nbsp;
The architecture of this building is of the Tudor style; and the
genius of Mr. Harrison has accomplished a work which, while
highly creditable to himself, is, at the same time, a genuine
ornament to the city.&nbsp; The clock turret at the north-west
corner, though it somewhat destroys the equilibrium of sight,
yet, on the whole, adds much of beauty to the general
fabric.&nbsp; The clock, which works four faces, and chimes the
quarters on two melodious bells, was constructed by Mr. Joyce, of
Whitchurch.</p>
<p>The ordinary business of this Bank is conducted in two large
rooms, nearly twenty feet square, on the ground floor; over which
a spiral staircase conducts to the committee and lecture-room, a
noble apartment, forty-one feet long by twenty feet wide, lit on
the north and west sides by four handsome traceried
windows.&nbsp; The panelled ceiling, and other internal
decorations of this room, are exceedingly chaste, and in happy
unison with its exterior character.&nbsp; The Bank was formally
transferred here from Goss Street in March, 1853.&nbsp; Here the
poor and thrifty hoard up their little savings; the shillings
grow into pounds, and provision is thus quietly, but surely, made
against the rainy day.&nbsp; Let us never despise the day of
small things, remembering that the foundation of many a rich
man&rsquo;s fortune has been laid with his first shilling
deposited in a Savings Bank.</p>
<p>On the right is St. Bridget&rsquo;s Church; and from this spot
we obtain a capital view of the <span
class="smcap">Castle</span>, including the Grand Entrance, Shire
Hall, Barrack Square, and Julius C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s Tower.&nbsp;
We have noticed the Castle more particularly in our &ldquo;Walk
round the City Walls;&rdquo; so we will now pass on towards the
Grosvenor Bridge, one of the modern wonders of old Chester.&nbsp;
From the parapet of this bridge we obtain a splendid view of the
Roodeye and river, as well as of the Viaduct and Railway Bridge
in the distance.&nbsp; This bridge has obtained an unenviable
notoriety from its having broken down with a passenger train, on
May 24, 1847, precipitating the whole of the carriages and
passengers into the river below.&nbsp; By this <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>accident four
persons were killed upon the spot, and very many others more or
less injured.</p>
<p>We are no sooner over the Grosvenor Bridge than we feel
ourselves at once out of range of the town, and breathing the
fresh and balmy air of the country.&nbsp; Bowers of trees are on
either side of us, through which we can see, upon our left hand,
something which seems like unto a Christian temple.&nbsp; The
gateway we are approaching stands invitingly open; let us
therefore step in, and cast a quiet glance at the prospect
around.&nbsp; Despite the rose-clad lodge which guards the
entrance, and the numerous flowers and shrubs that everywhere
greet the eye, we are at once struck that this is a sacred scene,
a royal domain of the grim King Death.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tread
lightly,&rdquo; then, all who would venture in hither, for
assuredly &ldquo;this is holy ground;&rdquo; and while we
reverently scan the numerous memorials of the departed lying
scattered around, let us all prepare, ere the day be too far
spent, to follow them in peace and in hope to our last earthly
home.&nbsp; There are few but have, at some time or other, borne
a friend to the grave&mdash;perhaps even the soul and centre of
their domestic hearth; <i>our</i> &lsquo;household god&rsquo;
lies peacefully <i>here</i>.&nbsp; To all such these lines,
coming thus from among the tombs, will lose nought of their
original force and beauty:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forget not the Dead, who have loved, who have left
us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who bend o&rsquo;er us now from their bright homes
above;<br />
But believe, never doubt, that the God who bereft us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Permits them to mingle with friends they still
love.</p>
<p>Repeat their fond words&mdash;all their noble deeds
cherish&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Speak pleasantly of them who left us in tears;<br />
From our lips their dear names other joys should not perish,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; While time bears our feet through the valley of
years.</p>
<p>Yea, forget not the Dead, who are evermore nigh us,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Still floating sometimes round our dream-haunted
bed;<br />
In the loneliest hour, in the crowd they are by us!&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forget not the Dead,&mdash;oh! forget not the
Dead!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Chester Cemetery</span>, for such is
the beautiful spot we are exploring, seems as if formed by nature
for the repose of the dead&mdash;all is so still, so serenely
still, within its halllowed sphere.&nbsp; Nature and Art have
alike combined to produce here a retreat worthy of the dead, and
yet full of beauty and allurement for the living; while on the
lake below us</p>
<blockquote><p>See how yon swans, with snowy pride elate,<br />
Arch their high necks, and sail along in state;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>In
fine, the beautiful trees and shrubs, the serpentine walks, the
rustic bridges, the isle-dotted lake, the ivied rock-work, the
modest chapels, and, above all, the tombstones of chaste and
mostly appropriate design which meet us at every turn&mdash;all
point out the Chester Cemetery as a fitting refuge for all, who
in serious mood would &ldquo;commune with their own hearts, and
be still.&rdquo;&nbsp; But we must not longer linger here, save
to cast a look towards the ancient city, the river, Castle, and
the New and Old Bridges, which from the north side of the
Cemetery present to the eye a varied and truly interesting
panorama.</p>
<p>Opposite to the Cemetery, reached from the Grosvenor Road by a
pretty little suspension bridge, is <span class="smcap">Curzon
Park</span>, the property of Earl Howe, and upon which some
handsome, aristocratic villas have been erected.&nbsp; It is from
Curzon Park whence that view of the city is obtained which
figures as the frontispiece of this &ldquo;Guide,&rdquo; and
certainly from no point is old Chester seen to greater advantage
than from this elevated and commanding locality.</p>
<p>Continuing our course from the Cemetery, we come to what we
who live in towns and travel only by rail, so seldom meet
with&mdash;a turnpike-gate,&mdash;through which we see the
<i>Grosvenor Gateway</i>, to be noticed more particularly
hereafter.&nbsp; A road upon the left leads to <span
class="smcap">Handbridge</span> and <span
class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Park</span>, and that upon the right
to one of the most thriving suburbs of Chester, <span
class="smcap">Hough Green</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Saltney</span>.&nbsp; Now, <i>we</i> are not
troubled with a superfluity of grey hairs, yet do we well
remember <span class="smcap">Saltney</span> when but two houses
occupied the site of the present little town.&nbsp; There was
nothing heard <i>then</i> of the <i>Port</i> and <i>trade of
Saltney</i>!&nbsp; But since the cutting of the two great
Railways which form a junction, though not an alliance, at this
spot, <span class="smcap">Saltney</span> has rapidly risen in
importance and population.&nbsp; A large Ironworks and coal trade
have been established, new streets have sprung up, yclept
severally Cable Street, Curzon Street, Wood Street, &amp;c., and
the number of inhabitants is now computed at about 3000.&nbsp;
The new Church, erected in 1854&ndash;5, comes scarcely within
our province, standing just beyond the boundaries of the city,
which is here separated only by a narrow lane from the
Principality of <span class="smcap">Wales</span>.&nbsp; Looking
at the rapidity with which building is going on at <span
class="smcap">Saltney</span>, and at the causes which have
induced it, we shall not go far wrong in predicting for this
&lsquo;child of the old city&rsquo; a long future of commercial
health and prosperity.</p>
<p>Returning once more to <span class="smcap">Bridge
Street</span>, we must pause awhile at <span class="smcap">St.
Michael&rsquo;s Church</span>, standing at the north-east angle
of this <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>street and Pepper Street.&nbsp; A Church existed here,
in connexion with a Monastery of the same name, almost
co&euml;val with the Conquest.&nbsp; In the year 1178, John de
Lacy, constable of Chester, whose ancestor Roger de Lacy had
devised the <i>Monastery of St. Michael</i> to the Prior of
Norton, gave a messuage adjoining this church to the Abbot of
Stanlaw.&nbsp; Two years afterwards, viz., on Mid-lent Sunday
1180, this Church and monastery were, with a large portion of the
city, destroyed by fire; and Bradshaw the poet-monk assures us,
doubtless &ldquo;on the best authority,&rdquo; that if it had not
been for the virtues attaching to the holy shrine of St.
Werburgh, the whole city would have then &ldquo;lain in dust and
ashes!&rdquo;&nbsp; He that hath faith enough to remove
mountains, let him swallow this also&mdash;<i>we</i> are
confessedly an infidel.&nbsp; The <i>Monastery</i> does not
appear to have been rebuilt after the Great Fire; but of the
<i>Church</i> frequent mention is made in old charters and
deeds.&nbsp; It has been several times rebuilt&mdash;<a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>the last time
in 1849&ndash;50&mdash;so that it is, at this moment, the newest
ecclesiastical edifice in the city.&nbsp; Mr. James Harrison, the
architect of the Savings Bank and Music Hall, furnished the plans
and elevations for the present Church of St. Michael.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best view we can have of <span class="smcap">St.
Michael&rsquo;s Church</span> is from a little way down Bridge
Street, just opposite to that useful building, the <span
class="smcap">New Lecture Hall</span>.&nbsp; Chester has long
stood in need of a room for such purposes, moderate in
dimensions, and conveniently situate; and Dr. Norton, the
proprietor of the new <span class="smcap">Lecture Hall</span>,
has laudably ministered to that want, by providing a public room
admirably adapted, from its size and situation, for popular
lectures and musical entertainments.&nbsp; Our illustration
embraces a view both of the <span class="smcap">Lecture
Hall</span> and of <span class="smcap">St. Michael&rsquo;s
Church</span>.</p>
<p>Just behind where we have been standing is a curious relic of
the timber architecture of Chester&mdash;the Falcon Inn.&nbsp; A
few yards higher up than the Falcon, the street was for nearly
two centuries blocked up by a strange-looking timber building,
erected by Randle Holme in 1655, called the <span
class="smcap">Old Lamb Row</span>.&nbsp; While this house was in
being it was the greatest curiosity of its kind in the city; but
in 1821, the decaying timbers suddenly parted from their
bearings, and the entire pile fell in with a great crash, to the
unspeakable relief of the pent-up thoroughfare, but to the great
chagrin and regret of the antiquary.</p>
<p>We are now descending <span class="smcap">Lower Bridge
Street</span>, which abounds, on either side, with those
queer-looking tenements, not to be met with in such numbers and
variety in any other city but Chester.&nbsp; Here is one with the
date 1603, evidently the residence, in its earliest days, of some
Cestrian magnate long since &ldquo;returned to his
dust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But see! yonder rattles a bus, with a party from the station,
down to that first-class establishment, the <span
class="smcap">Albion Hotel</span>.&nbsp; This house has no
superior in the city; for while of handsome external proportions,
its interior arrangements have all been conceived with especial
regard to the comfort and convenience of visitors.&nbsp; The
<i>Assembly Room</i> is the largest in the city; the other rooms
are light and lofty; in short, under the zealous superintendence
of Mr. and Mrs. Chambers, none who once make acquaintance with
the <span class="smcap">Albion</span> will ever sigh for better
or more comfortable quarters.&nbsp; Behind the <span
class="smcap">Hotel</span> are extensive pleasure-grounds, as
well as a verdant and spacious Bowling-green, to which there is a
carriage entrance from <i>Park Street</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Only a
step or two from the Albion, and on the same side, near the
residence of <span class="smcap">Mr. Snape</span>, the eminent
dentist, is <i>St. Olave&rsquo;s Lane</i>, so named from the
Lilliputian church, dedicated to that saint, at its south-west
corner.&nbsp; This Church dates back earlier than the
Conquest.&nbsp; The advowson in the eleventh century was vested
in the Botelers or Butlers; from whom it passed by gift of
Richard Pincerna, in 1101, to the Abbey of St. Werburgh.&nbsp;
<span class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s</span> appears to have been
always &ldquo;in low water,&rdquo; a <i>starving</i> rather than
a <i>living</i>; for in 1393, on account of its poverty, the
parish was temporarily united with St. Mary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Down
to the seventeenth century, however, it eked out a precarious
existence; but after the close of the civil war, the ordinary
services of the church were discontinued for about a century;
when they were again resumed, until the final extinction of <span
class="smcap">St. Olave&rsquo;s</span> as a distinct parish, in
1841.&nbsp; In that year the Church was finally closed, and the
parish united to that of St. Michael.&nbsp; The &ldquo;powers <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>that
be&rdquo; are fast allowing this ancient structure to develop
into a ruin.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Opposite to St. Olave&rsquo;s is <span class="smcap">Castle
Street</span>; beyond which, up a flight of steps, is a large
tenement, of late years known as the <i>Boarding-School
Yard</i>.&nbsp; This was in the seventeenth century the
mansion-house of the Gamulls, a worthy Cheshire family; and here,
on September 27, 1645, Sir Francis Gamull (Mayor of Chester in
1634) lodged and entertained Charles I. on his Majesty&rsquo;s
visit to Chester during the great Civil War.&nbsp; The house is
now divided into tenements; but several of the rooms still retain
evidence of their original splendour.</p>
<p>Still farther down, we have upon the left <i>Duke Street</i>,
and on the right <i>Shipgate Street</i>, through which, in old
time, the citizens used to pass by way of the Ship Gate, across
the river, into Handbridge.&nbsp; It leads also to St.
Mary&rsquo;s Hill; on the summit of which, half-embowered in
trees, we are introduced to the ancient Church of <span
class="smcap">St. Mary</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s Church</span> is in all
probability of Norman foundation; and is in old writings termed
indifferently <i>St. Mary&rsquo;s of the Castle</i>, and <i>St.
Mary&rsquo;s upon the Hill</i>, to distinguish it from the
handsome Church of the White Friars, which was also dedicated to
that saint.&nbsp; Randle Gernons, fourth earl of Chester,
presented the advowson to the Monastery of St. Werburgh; but
shortly after the dissolution it was wrested from the dean and
chapter by that rapacious spoiler of churches and religious
houses, Sir R. Cotton, who afterwards sold it for 100<i>l.</i> to
John Brereton of Wettenhall.&nbsp; In this family it continued
for about a century, when it passed by purchase to the Wilbrahams
of Dorfold.&nbsp; From them it came by marriage to the Hills of
Hough, whose representative sold it to the father of the present
Marquis of Westminster.&nbsp; Of no external beauty, with a tower
of miserably stunted proportions (so built in 1715, in order that
it might not overlook the Castle), <span class="smcap">St.
Mary&rsquo;s Church</span> is nevertheless well deserving a visit
from all lovers of true ecclesiastical order.&nbsp; Here is a
Church which, when <i>we</i> first remember it, was a disgrace
alike to the authorities and to the parish&mdash;choked up with
galleries of hideous shape and size&mdash;disfigured with pews of
unsightly construction,&mdash;the walls and ceilings buried in
plaster, whitewash, and dust, and the monuments and windows all
alike in a state of ruin and decay.&nbsp; Let us step into the
Church, and survey the change which has been effected within a
few short years.&nbsp; We are no sooner inside, than we are at
once convinced that this is indeed the House of God, <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>gradually,
and, under the auspices of the present worthy rector,
<i>judiciously</i> returning to its first estate, as a seemly
temple, worthy of the Most High.&nbsp; Here is none of that
venerable dust, that insidious mould, so painfully visible in
other churches we might mention; but everything we see, from the
floor to the ceiling, from the altar to the organ, is both
correct in taste, scrupulously clean, and in most beautiful,
Church-like order.&nbsp; The Church consists of a nave, with a
clerestory of twelve lights, and a handsome panelled roof adorned
with Christian monograms and devices,&mdash;two side
aisles,&mdash;two chancel chapels, named respectively
<i>Troutbeck&rsquo;s</i> and <i>St.
Catherine&rsquo;s</i>,&mdash;and a spacious chancel, in which are
some elaborately carved stalls and open seats.&nbsp; So rapidly
as stolid prejudice will admit, this uniform style of seat will
be adopted throughout the Church.</p>
<p>The monuments within the Church are of considerable
interest.&nbsp; One there is, in the north aisle, profuse in
heraldic display, to the imperishable memory of the four <span
class="smcap">Randal Holmes</span>, local antiquaries and heralds
of considerable note, whose united Cheshire collections fill more
than 250 MS. volumes in the British Museum.&nbsp; The third
Randal was the author of that extraordinary and scarce heraldic
work,&mdash;the &ldquo;Academy of Armory&rdquo; published in
1688.&nbsp; An elegant modern brass, and two altar-tombs of
curious workmanship, adorn St. Catherine&rsquo;s Chapel, at the
end of this aisle.&nbsp; One of the latter remembers Thomas
Gamull, Recorder of Chester in 1613, son of Edmund Gamull,
aforetime Mayor of Chester, and father of the celebrated royalist
Sir Francis Gamull, who suffered sequestration of his estates
during the Usurpation.&nbsp; The recumbent figures of the
Recorder and his wife Alice appear upon the tomb; and at the feet
of the lady kneels their infant son, afterwards the loyal Sir
Francis Gamull.&nbsp; Their three infant daughters, holding
skulls in their hands, and two elaborate shields of arms,
ornament the side of the tomb.&nbsp; A similar tomb near bears
the half-recumbent effigy of Philip Oldfield of Bradwall, dressed
in the costume of the period, with a long gown and ruff, and a
roll in his left hand.&nbsp; The figures of his four sons, each
bearing a shield of arms, support the slab on which he leans, and
between them a painted skeleton, in a similar attitude to the
effigy, appears on the side of the tomb.&nbsp; Two daughters
kneel at his head, and these also bear shields, in token of their
marriage.&nbsp; Both these monuments are deserving the attention
of the curious.</p>
<p>One of the north windows, by the side of these relics, is
filled with stained glass.&nbsp; The east window also of this
aisle, attracting <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the eye of the visitor the moment he enters, has just
been adorned with an obituary memorial of intense national
interest.&nbsp; Erected by public subscription, this window
commemorates the glorious deeds of the gallant 23rd Regiment
(Royal Welsh Fusileers) at the battles of Alma, Inkermann, and
Sebastopol in 1854&ndash;5.&nbsp; The 23rd is a regiment highly
esteemed by the Cestrians, nay, almost regarded by them as their
own; and most of those brave spirits, officers and men, who nobly
fell &ldquo;with their faces to the foe&rdquo; on those hard-won
fields, had but a few months before regularly attended divine
service at <span class="smcap">St. Mary&rsquo;s
Church</span>.&nbsp; The subject represented in the window is
Aaron and Hur holding up the hands of Moses, while the patriarch
blesses the warring hosts of Israel; for as we read, in Exodus
xvii. ver. 11, 12, &ldquo;Moses&rsquo; hands were heavy, and
Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side, and
the other on the other; for it came to pass, that when Moses held
up his hands Israel prevailed, and when his hands fell down,
Amalek prevailed.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is a pretty and appropriate
subject for such a memorial as this, implying the Christian
Soldier&rsquo;s dependence upon the God of Battles!</p>
<p>The chancel, and Troutbeck chapel in the south aisle, also
contain some tasteful and appropriate painted windows, ancient
and modern; and on the south wall of the latter were discovered,
a few years ago, some curious remains of ancient mural painting,
representing the <i>Crucifixion</i> and <i>Resurrection</i> in
curious juxtaposition with the figures of a <i>King</i>, a
<i>Bishop</i>, and the <i>red and white roses</i> of York and
Lancaster.&nbsp; The many beautiful monuments once embellishing
the Troutbeck aisle were destroyed by the falling in of the roof
in 1660.&nbsp; In bidding adieu to the church of <i>St. Mary the
Virgin</i>, we may confidently assert that &ldquo;<i>ne vile
fano</i>&rdquo; is the motto of Mr. Massie, the present rector,
<a name="citation77"></a><a href="#footnote77"
class="citation">[77]</a> for a neater and better ordered church
we have not yet met with in our tour through the city.</p>
<p>Once more returning to Lower Bridge Street, we have before us
the <span class="smcap">Bridgegate</span>, and two or three
choice but eccentric-looking houses of the wood and plaster type,
as depicted in our engraving.</p>
<p>Passing under the <span class="smcap">Bridgegate</span>, by
the <span class="smcap">Dee Mills</span> and <span

might, if we chose, wander forth into <span

suburb deserving our especial notice.&nbsp; As it is, however, we
will make good our return to <span class="smcap">The

School.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> tours of inspection have, so
far, been all down hill; let us now, then, take higher ground,
and move glibly onward up <span class="smcap">Northgate
Street</span>.</p>
<p>Passing <span class="smcap">St. Peter&rsquo;s Church</span>,
at the corner of the street, we come immediately to that classic
pile of white freestone&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Commercial
Buildings and News Room</span>, erected in 1808, from the designs
of Mr. T. Harrison, the architect of the <span
class="smcap">Castle</span> and of the <span
class="smcap">Grosvenor Bridge</span>.</p>
<p>To this succeeds <span class="smcap">Shoemaker&rsquo;s
Row</span>, extending about a hundred yards along the left side
of the street.&nbsp; The Row upon the right hand used formerly to
be known as <i>Broken-shin Row</i>, from the rugged and uneven
character of the thoroughfare, and the manifest dangers that
threatened the <i>shins</i> of those who ventured along it.&nbsp;
Originally it is said to have been double its present length; but
modern innovation&mdash;that wolf in sheep&rsquo;s
clothing&mdash;has here, as elsewhere, played terrible havoc with
&ldquo;ye good olde citie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little higher up than this latter-named Row, we may
profitably turn round, and survey, from this slight eminence, the
lower part of the Street we have just traversed, together with
the curious architecture of the houses in <i>Shoemaker&rsquo;s
Row</i>.&nbsp; The scene is a picturesque one, with its
oddly-carved beams and overhanging gables, which look as if ready
to fall down on the beholder.&nbsp; But in order more fully to
impress it on your memory, we present you farther on with a
faithful sketch of <span class="smcap">Northgate Street</span>,
as seen from this point.</p>
<p>Onward we go, until an open space upon our left introduces us
to the Market-Place of Chester&rsquo;s famed city.&nbsp; The
market for vegetables is held in this area, with no other
covering save the &ldquo;bright blue sky;&rdquo; but the sale of
fish is conducted in that airy <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>looking building, which occupies, we
will not say <i>adorns</i>, the lower end of the
Market-Place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>But what is yon new-looking structure, overlooking the
Marketplace?&nbsp; <i>New</i>, did you say?&nbsp; Why, it is not
very far from a couple of hundred years since that building, the
<span class="smcap">Exchange</span>, first delighted the eyes of
the old-fashioned citizens.&nbsp; True, the stone-work has been
lately restored, and the bricks newly pointed; but practically
this is the same <span class="smcap">Exchange</span> which, in
1698, was completed at a cost of 1000<i>l.</i>,&mdash;Roger
Whitley, the then Mayor, being a large contributor.&nbsp; The
statue embellishing yonder niche on the south front is a graceful
representation of Queen Anne, of glorious memory, in her
coronation robes,&mdash;a work which must have emanated from no
mean chisel.&nbsp; The superstructure of the <span
class="smcap">Exchange</span> stood originally upon four rows of
stone columns, the ground floor being otherwise entirely open;
but in 1756, just a hundred years ago, owing to some
well-grounded fears for the safety of the structure, the lower
tiers of shops, &amp;c., were erected, <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>as an extra support to the fabric;
the greater portion of these are now occupied as police-offices,
lock-ups, &amp;c.&nbsp; On the higher story are the <i>Assembly
Room</i>, the <i>Pentice</i> or <i>Council Chamber</i>, and the
spacious <i>Town Hall</i>.&nbsp; The <i>Assembly Room</i> was a
popular resort in the last generation, when corporation feasts,
redolent of venison and primest turtle, were perpetually being
discussed there; but it is many a long day since these savoury
viands graced the aldermanic board.&nbsp; Oh, for the good old
days!&nbsp; The winter Assemblies, too, wont to be held here, are
now transferred to more congenial quarters at the Royal
Hotel.&nbsp; The <i>Town Hall</i>, which is the <i>Common
Hall</i> of the city, is a noble apartment, the walls ornamented
with full-length portraits of numerous city notables, among whom
figure Recorders Townsend, Leycester, Comberbach, and Williams;
and Sirs Henry Bunbury, and John Egerton, members for the city,
of eminence in their day.&nbsp; Here are held the Quarter
Sessions for the city, official public meetings, and the
Elections for <a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>the city representatives in parliament.&nbsp;
Immediately beyond this room is the <i>Pentice</i> or Council
Chamber, where the mayor and magistrates settle the accounts of
the drunk and disorderly, and take preliminary depositions in
cases of felony, &amp;c.&nbsp; This room, in which the Mayor is
also annually chosen by the Council, has on its walls full-length
portraits of George III., several members of the Grosvenor
family, and of William Cross, Esq., the first Reform Mayor of
Chester.&nbsp; Yonder series of large panels, contain portraits
of Owen Jones, Offley, and other famous benefactors to the poor
of the city.&nbsp; In a room in Abbey Square, the <i>City
Records</i>, extending from the reign of the first Edward to the
present time, are wretchedly huddled together&mdash;we wish we
could say <i>preserved</i>; but surely the day is not far distant
when a custodian of these important documents shall be appointed
by the Council,&mdash;one who shall not only understand, but also
<i>glorify</i> his office; then will many a dark epoch in the
city&rsquo;s history be unravelled, and many a fact revealed
which now lies hidden in the dust of obscurity.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Opposite to the <span class="smcap">Exchange</span> is <span
class="smcap">Saint Werburgh Street</span>, down which we must
straightway roam, having a glorious treat awaiting us, in our
long-promised visit to <span class="smcap">Chester
Cathedral</span>.</p>
<p>But before we set foot within the sacred fane, let us proceed
a little further, in order to examine yonder stately-looking
pile, only just completed,&mdash;to wit, the <span
class="smcap">New Music Hall</span>.&nbsp; Perhaps no structure
within the city has undergone greater or more numerous changes of
character than the shell of the one we are now surveying.&nbsp;
The first we hear of it is as the Chapel of St. Nicholas, built,
it is supposed, early in the fourteenth century.&nbsp; About this
time, we read that the monks of St. Werburgh (monks were greedy
dogs!), wishing to have the whole Cathedral to themselves,
transferred the parish Church of St. Oswald, then as now
occupying the south transept of the Cathedral, to this Chapel of
St. Nicholas, which latter had perhaps been built with that idea
&ldquo;looming in the future.&rdquo;&nbsp; But the parishioners
and corporation repudiated the change, and after much litigation
recovered their old parish Church,&mdash;so the chapel of St.
Nicholas was speedily deserted.&nbsp; After being &ldquo;to
let&rdquo; for some fifty or sixty years, we next hear of it as
the <span class="smcap">Common Hall</span> of the city, removed
here from Common-hall Street in 1545.&nbsp; In this service it
remained, the arena of <i>law</i>, if not of <i>justice</i> (for
the two do not always go hand in hand), until 1698, when the
magisterial chair was removed to its present resting-place in the
<span class="smcap">Exchange</span>.&nbsp; The third phase in <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>its existence
was its conversion into the warehouse of a common carrier, and
into a mart for the sale of <i>wool</i>; the name it then bore
was the <span class="smcap">Wool Hall</span>.&nbsp; Again was St.
Nicholas the victim of transformation; for, at least as early as
the year 1727, the walls, which once echoed forth the sounds of
prayer and praise, were made to ring with the ribald jests of a
common <i>playhouse</i>.&nbsp; Thirty years afterwards, there
were two Theatres open at one time in Chester,&mdash;one
<i>here</i>, and the other at the Tennis Court in Foregate
Street; but about 1768, the latter establishment was closed up,
and its &ldquo;galaxy of talent&rdquo; transferred to the Wool
Hall.&nbsp; In 1777, the necessary patent from the crown was
obtained for the licensing of the premises, and the Wool Hall
forthwith developed into a <span class="smcap">Theatre
Royal</span>.&nbsp; We will not stay to run over the numerous
&ldquo;stars&rdquo; which have from time to time graced this
theatrical firmament; it is enough to know that this &ldquo;light
of other days has faded&rdquo; away, and that, so far as this
building is concerned, the <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>Chester Theatre exists only as matter
of history.&nbsp; In 1854&ndash;5, the Theatre was wholly
obliterated, and the building in great part taken down; but the
massive buttresses and sidelight arches of the original
ecclesiastical structure were suffered to remain, and are yet
plainly visible upon the north and south sides of the
building.&nbsp; And now comes the last scene of the
drama,&mdash;the scene we are now contemplating.&nbsp; On the
ruins of the fallen Theatre, and on the foundation walls of the
ancient Chapel of St. Nicholas, modern enterprise has raised a
pile more in unison with its first estate, and far more worthy
its close proximity to the Cathedral,&mdash;the <span
class="smcap">New Music Hall</span>.&nbsp; The Hall has been
erected from the designs of Mr. James Harrison, architect, whose
other important works about the city we have already
noticed.&nbsp; Its peculiar position, beset with heavy private
buildings on three of its sides, prevented much attention being
paid to the exterior; but the east front, being comparatively
free, has afforded Mr. Harrison an opportunity for displaying his
professional skill.&nbsp; Seen from the other end of St.
Werburgh&rsquo;s Place, the handsome Tudor windows and porch of
this front have a rich and truly picturesque effect; our artist,
however, has chosen a nearer view, in order to give strength and
definition to his sketch.&nbsp; In addition to a refreshment
room, ladies&rsquo; waiting and retiring rooms, and other
offices, the interior presents to us a large and noble hall, 108
feet long, 40 feet wide, and 50 feet high, capable, with its two
handsome galleries, of accommodating an audience of 1400
people.&nbsp; Its spacious orchestra, adorned with an organ of
superior excellence, by Jackson, has ample room for 250
performers.&nbsp; The neatly panelled roof, resting upon shafted
cross-beams tastefully ornamented, gives to the <span
class="smcap">Chester Music Hall</span> a richness and elegance
wholly unapproached by any similar room in the city.&nbsp; The
Hall is, in every respect, a credit alike to the architect and to
the city; and it is not too much to add that Mr. J. D. Williams,
the builder and decorator of the structure, has done his part of
the work faithfully and well.&nbsp; One man only was killed
during the progress of the works, by an accidental fall from the
ceiling of the Hall.&nbsp; It was opened Nov. 26, 1855, with a
grand concert, at which Clara Novello and others officiated.</p>

</a></p>
<p>And now for our long-deferred visit to the venerable <span
class="smcap">Cathedral</span>.&nbsp; Turning aside from the
Music Hall, we pass a small gate, and are at once in close
communion with the south-west side of this massive
structure.&nbsp; We can see from this point, distinctly enough,
the ancient cruciform character of the edifice, that fittest
symbolical <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>form of a Christian Church; the east end forming the
choir and Lady Chapel,&mdash;the south transept the Parish Church
of St. Oswald,&mdash;the north transept almost
unappropriated,&mdash;and the west end the nave, into which
latter we are now passing through a rich and handsome Tudor
porch.&nbsp; And here let us observe that, as our knowledge of
architectural detail is unhappily small, we must rely for our
descriptions on the &ldquo;dogmatic teaching&rdquo; of other and
abler heads.&nbsp; But first a word or two on the foundation and
history of this fine old <span
class="smcap">Cathedral</span>.</p>
<p>Tradition avers that under the imperial dominion of pagan
Rome, a temple, dedicated to Apollo, occupied the spot now
consecrated to the Triune God; and that this temple had itself
supplanted a still older fane of the superstitious Druids.&nbsp;
However this may be, it is an historical fact, amply
corroborated, that Wulpherus, King of the Mercians, who
flourished about <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 660, and
Ermenilde, his queen, perceiving the attachment of their
daughter, St. Werburgh, to a religious life, built an Abbey at
Chester, for her and such other pious ladies who should, in like
manner, prefer a conventual life.&nbsp; To St. Peter and St. Paul
this Saxon Abbey was dedicated.&nbsp; St. Werburgh, being
prioress or patron of three Abbeys&mdash;Chester, Trentham, and
Hanbury&mdash;died and was buried in the latter edifice; but
owing to the threatened incursions of the Danes, her sacred
relics were thence removed, two hundred years afterwards, to
Chester, for greater security, and lodged in the Abbey her royal
father had founded in her honour.&nbsp; About 907, Ethelfleda,
Countess of Mercia, erected on the same site a nobler Abbey,
dedicated to her whose shrine then rested there&mdash;the
immaculate St. Werburgh.&nbsp; Thus matters remained for nearly
two centuries, when Earl Hugh Lupus, nephew and favourite of the
Conqueror, having lived a life of debauchery and excess,
compounded for his sins by the erection of an edifice larger and
more splendid than the last, founding there a Monastery of St.
Bennet&rsquo;s order, under the superintendence of Anselm, then
abbot of Bec, in Normandy, afterwards Archbishop of
Canterbury.&nbsp; A day or two before his death, Earl Hugh was
shorn a monk of the Abbey his own remorseful bounty had
founded.&nbsp; Immense possessions accrued to the Abbey, both
from Hugh Lupus, the founder, and from his successors in the
earldom.&nbsp; Early in the reign of Edward I., and in the abbacy
of Simon <i>de Albo Monasterio</i> (Whitchurch), the rebuilding
of the Abbey was commenced.&nbsp; It continued slowly to
progress, under succeeding abbots, for about two hundred years,
and until Abbot <i>Simon Ripley</i> virtually completed, <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>in 1492, the
erection of the Cathedral as we see it in the present day.&nbsp;
Only fifty years afterwards, the foul blast of destruction fell
like an avalanche upon the monastic institutions of
Britain&mdash;Chester among the number.&nbsp; Bluff King Hal,
that shameless polygamist, in a fit of pretended religious zeal,
dissolved all these fraternities, and, pocketing the spoil, dealt
out their lands to his creatures with right royal
munificence.&nbsp; True, he left us the <i>shell</i>, in his new
foundation of a Cathedral and Chapter; but he gulped up the
<i>kernel</i> in the shape of the manorial possessions of the
Abbey.&nbsp; John Bird was the first peculiar Bishop of Chester;
and Thomas Clarke transposed himself from the last Romanist Abbot
to the first Protestant Dean of Chester.</p>
<p>Entering the <span class="smcap">Cathedral</span> by the South
Porch, we find ourselves in the <span class="smcap">Nave</span>,
and close to a lofty chamber now used as the Consistory
Court.&nbsp; Here are tried, before the chancellor of the
diocese, the validity or otherwise of disputed wills, actions for
slander, and other causes falling within the province of
ecclesiastical law.&nbsp; Beyond, and to the left of this Court,
near the baptismal font, is the great West Entrance of the
Cathedral, built during the energetic rule of the Abbot Simon
Ripley.&nbsp; It was the design of Ripley to erect two massive
towers at this end of the Cathedral, and the foundations of these
towers are still existing there; but owing to an unexpected
&ldquo;fall in the funds,&rdquo; or to some other cause, the
original intention was never carried out.</p>
<p>The West Entrance, as we now behold it, has a large and
magnificent window of delicate tracery, recently filled with a
series of designs in stained glass, illustrating the final
sentence of the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, &ldquo;The Resurrection of
the Body, and the Life Everlasting.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the centre of
the main opening, we have the &ldquo;Appearance of our Lord to
St. Mary Magdalene in the Garden;&rdquo; and beneath, &ldquo;Our
Lord&rsquo;s Supper with the Disciples at Emmaus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The three lights south of the centre illustrate the
&ldquo;Resurrection of our Lord,&rdquo; above Whom are seen the
Heavenly Host, while below are the affrighted soldiers, the angel
at the tomb, with the apostles and holy women.&nbsp; In the three
divisions on the north side is depicted &ldquo;Our Lord in
Judgment,&rdquo; surrounded by the patriarchs, prophets,
apostles, and saints: beneath is the Archangel Michael trampling
upon Satan, with groups of &ldquo;the Just&rdquo; on their way up
to Heaven, accompanied by guardian angels.&nbsp; The rich tracery
overhead is filled with the &ldquo;Genealogical Tree of our
Lord,&rdquo; commencing with the reclining figure of Jesse, and
its branches spreading through more than one hundred openings,
finishing with the birth, death, and <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>glorification of Jesus Christ.&nbsp;
This is a memorial window, erected by the widow of the Rev. P. W.
Hamilton, of Hoole, near Chester, and cannot fail to be an object
of surpassing interest to every visitor.&nbsp; It was designed
and executed by Messrs. M. and A. O&rsquo;Connor, of London.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The door being open, let us step out to the open air, and
refresh our eyes with a momentary glance at the <span
class="smcap">West Entrance of the Cathedral</span>.&nbsp; This
is, externally, the most beautiful remaining portion of this
glorious edifice.&nbsp; Time has, of course, been at work here,
as elsewhere, gnawing away at the old red sandstone; <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>but there is
still enough left to give us an idea of its ancient beauty.</p>
<blockquote><p>Forms of saints are meekly kneeling<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cathedral door above:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the which door is a beautiful double Tudor arch of chaste
design, supported on either side by four canopied niches, once
ornamented with statuettes, but now fast going to decay.&nbsp;
Over this is the great west window of eight lights, the whole
flanked by two fine octagonal turrets with embattled
parapets.&nbsp; Altogether, this front is a sight grateful to
look upon, but one eminently suggestive of the ephemeral
character of all things here below.</p>
<p>Returning to the Nave, we find at the head of the north aisle
a flight of stairs leading up through the arched doorway into the
Episcopal Palace; through this door the bishop ordinarily enters
the Cathedral in his robes.&nbsp; The external wall of this aisle
is one of the most ancient portions of the entire structure,
being part of the Norman edifice of Hugh Lupus.&nbsp; It has two
doors, one at each end, opening to the east and west walks of the
<span class="smcap">Cloisters</span>, of which more anon.&nbsp;
The windows of the Nave and of the clerestory above it, are all
of the perpendicular character, and throw a flood of dim
religious light into the interior.&nbsp; There is but one
stained-glass window, and <i>that</i> an obituary one, in the
south aisle of the nave.&nbsp; Numerous monuments deck the walls,
and disfigure the pillars of the nave, conspicuous among which
are those to Dean Smith, translator of Longinus, Thucydides, and
other classic authors; also memorials of the Mainwaring, Dod,
Buchanan, Matthews, Ward, and Hilton families.&nbsp; One in the
north aisle to the memory of Captain John Moore Napier, who died
in India of Asiatic cholera, is worthy of special remark, from
the spirited and touching epitaph, written by his uncle, that
brave and gallant soldier, Sir Charles Napier, the veteran hero
of Scinde.&nbsp; It runs thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The tomb is no record of high lineage;<br />
His may be traced by his name.<br />
His race was one of soldiers;<br />
Among soldiers he lived, among them he died,<br />
A soldier falling where numbers fell with him<br />
In a barbarous land.<br />
Yet there died none more generous,<br />
More daring, more gifted, more religious.<br />
On his early grave<br />
Fell the tears of stern and hardy men,<br />
As his had fallen on the grave of others.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>True
poetry this, albeit expressed in modest prose!&nbsp; The Nave is

</table>
<p>Through an oaken door at the extremity of the north aisle, we
pass into the north wing of the Transept,&mdash;like the Nave,
not appropriated to any of the ordinary services of the
church.&nbsp; The lower portion of its walls is indisputably
Norman work, as is evidenced by the seven-arched triforium, which
traverses midway its eastern side.&nbsp; A small doorway in the
corner of this wall leads up, by a spiral staircase, to the
triforium and great tower, as also to the clerestory gallery,
which &ldquo;threads its devious course&rdquo; almost wholly
round the sacred edifice.&nbsp; The archway under the great north
window of the Transept conducts to the Chapter House and
Cathedral Library.&nbsp; Two monuments in this wing deserve our
notice,&mdash;one to the memory of Sir John Grey Egerton, Bart.,
sometime M.P. for Chester,&mdash;and the other to Colonel Roger
Barnston, of Chester, erected by the subscriptions of his
admiring friends and fellow-citizens.&nbsp; Immediately over the
monument of Sir John Egerton is placed a piece of magnificent
tapestry, copied from one of Raphael&rsquo;s masterpieces,
representing &ldquo;Elymas the sorcerer struck with blindness
before Sergius Paulus.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is stated to have been
brought over from a nunnery in France, and, until the recent
alterations, usurped the place of the reredos at the back of the
High Altar.</p>
<p>Thence returning to the Nave, we pass under the massive stone
screen into the <span class="smcap">Choir</span>, and are at once
filled with admiration of its noble proportions, and of the taste
and elegance which everywhere pervade it.&nbsp; The great
features of the structure we have hitherto examined have been
chiefly architectural, but here we are introduced to a scene in
which all the resources of human art have been <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>brought to
bear by the creature man in honour of his Creator God.&nbsp; Look
at this gorgeous canopy of ancient oak, adorning and supporting
the fine organ overhead&mdash;at that magnificent range of
Stalls, also of old oak, four-and-twenty on either side, crowned
with canopies of the richest tracery, no one stall a copy of the
other&mdash;at those pews of fairest form and choicest
elaboration&mdash;at yon Shrine of St. Werburgh, now the
Episcopal Throne&mdash;at the handsome stone pulpit&mdash;at the
bold oak lectern, the eagle bearing upon his wings the glad
tidings of salvation&mdash;at the graceful Altar-screen and Holy
Table&mdash;and at the stained-glass enrichments of the two great
east windows, through which gleams the morning sun,</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dyed<br
/>
In the soft chequerings of a sleepy light.&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As all these meet our wondering eyes, then do we awake to the
consciousness that this is the Lord&rsquo;s House, and, as it
richly deserves to be, the Mother Church of the city and
diocese.&nbsp; The seats of the <span
class="smcap">Stalls</span>, or <i>misericordi&aelig;</i>, are
worthy of our inspection, every one bearing some device different
from its companions.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Throne</span>
is composed, in great part, of the pedestal on which rested, in
Romish days, the sacred relics of St. Werburgh,&mdash;those
relics which, according to Father Bradshaw, performed such great
and astounding miracles.&nbsp; The images surrounding it are
supposed to be those of Mercian kings and saints, to which royal
line St. Werburgh belonged.&nbsp; The Throne has been improved
and raised some feet within the last fifteen years.&nbsp; The
stone <span class="smcap">Pulpit</span> replaced an older one of
monarch oak, which has since been transformed into a long open
seat for the Lady Chapel.&nbsp; The Communion Table and its
appointments are all in good taste; and the elegant stone <span
class="smcap">Reredos</span>, which divides the <span
class="smcap">Altar</span> from the Lady Chapel, is of
exceedingly chaste and appropriate character.&nbsp; The subjects
in the east clerestory window represent &ldquo;Our blessed Lord
between the four Evangelists,&rdquo; over whom are depicted five
incidents in Christ&rsquo;s career on earth,&mdash;the Agony in
the Garden&mdash;Jesus bearing His Cross&mdash;the
Crucifixion&mdash;the Resurrection&mdash;and the Ascension.&nbsp;
The entire length of the <span class="smcap">Choir</span> is 125
feet, breadth 74&frac12; feet, and height 78 feet.</p>
<p>The north aisle of the Choir has one stained-glass obituary
window, but no other object of interest, save a few old
monuments, and a vestry for the Canons, the latter being a
portion of the old Norman edifice.&nbsp; We pass hence to the
<span class="smcap">Lady Chapel</span>, at the east end of the
Choir, supposed by some to be the oldest portion of the <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>present
re-edified Cathedral.&nbsp; It is 65 feet long, 74&frac12; feet
wide, including the side aisles, and 33 feet high.&nbsp; The
Chapel consisted originally of one central aisle only, the two
side aisles having been added at a later period.&nbsp; At the
east end stood the Shrine of St. Werburgh, until the Reformation
saw it removed to the Choir, and converted thenceforward into the
Bishop&rsquo;s Throne.&nbsp; The east window of the Lady Chapel
is embellished with stained glass of the richest
description&mdash;the subjects being severally, the Annunciation,
the Nativity, the Wise Men&rsquo;s Offering, the Presentation in
the Temple, Christ disputing with the Doctors, the Baptism of
John, the Water turned into Wine, Healing the Lame, Walking on
the Sea, Feeding the Multitude, the Transfiguration, the Raising
of Lazarus, the Entry into Jerusalem, Washing the
Disciples&rsquo; Feet, and the Last Supper,&mdash;the whole
crowned with symbolical figures of the Twelve Apostles.&nbsp; In
this Chapel George Marsh was condemned to be burnt for heresy in
the days of Queen Mary.</p>
<p>The south aisle of the Choir and Lady Chapel has all its
windows adorned with stained glass, the one at the east end being
an obituary memorial for the late Hugh Robert Hughes, Esq., of
the Bache, erected by his son, inheritor from his uncle, Lord
Dinorben, of Kinmel Park, Flintshire.&nbsp; Obituary windows to
the Humberston and Anson families, and two others piously erected
by the present worthy Dean, complete the adornment of this
aisle.&nbsp; Dean Anson has done more to beautify his Cathedral
than all his predecessors put together!&nbsp; Under an indented
arch in the east wall recline the dust and ashes of one of the
abbots of St. Werburgh, the slab adorned with a cross
<i>floree</i>.&nbsp; In the centre of this aisle stands an
altar-tomb, once built into the wall of the Sedilia.&nbsp; This
tomb tradition assigns to Henry IV. of Germany; but it appears
that monarch died and was buried in his own dominions: other and
better authority surmises it to be the tomb of one of the later
abbots.</p>
<p>From this aisle we pass into the south wing of the Transept,
time out of mind appropriated to the parish <span
class="smcap">Church of St. Oswald</span>.&nbsp; So early as the
ninth century, a Church existed here, independent of the Abbey;
but on the enlargement of the latter in the thirteenth century,
St. Oswald&rsquo;s became incorporated with the Abbey, as its
southern transept.&nbsp; This was the Church, the functions of
which were transferred by the monks to St. Nicholas Chapel, now
the <span class="smcap">Music Hall</span>; but the parishioners
could not forget their first love, and soon wormed their way back
again to <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>St. Oswald&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The Church contains some
handsome monuments, worthy the attention of the visitor.</p>
<p>Crossing the nave, we see opposite to us a door, introducing
us to the <span class="smcap">Cloisters</span> of this once
powerful Abbey.&nbsp; The arch we are now passing under is a
Norman specimen of exceeding purity; and disfigured as it has
been by modern <i>improvements</i>, yet affords a high degree of
interest to the intelligent antiquary.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Cloisters</span> once formed a quadrangle of 110
feet square; but the south portion has almost entirely
disappeared, the bases of some of the pillars alone
remaining.&nbsp; The east walk has a doorway leading into the
<span class="smcap">Chapter House</span>, through a vaulted
Vestibule of great architectural beauty.&nbsp; These two
apartments were the favourite places of sepulture of the puissant
Norman earls, as well as of the earlier abbots of the
Monastery.&nbsp; In the Chapter House, which is a noble building
of the twelfth century, are deposited the Cathedral Library, as
well as some vestiges of antiquity found within the Abbey and its
precincts.&nbsp; Of these, a part of the stone coffin of Abbot
Simon Ripley, and a Roman red sandstone inscription found near
the present Deanery, are the most prominent and
interesting.&nbsp; Over the door hang two bullet-tattered flags,
once belonging to the 22nd (Cheshire) Regiment.&nbsp; A passage
beyond the Chapter House leads, by the Maiden&rsquo;s Walk, into
the Abbey Court; and a doorway at the northwest corner to the
Dormitory, now totally destroyed.&nbsp; A beautiful Norman
chamber runs along the side of the western walk, and is variously
designated the Promptuarium and <i>Abbot&rsquo;s Hall</i>.&nbsp;
This apartment, although an engraving of it appeared in
Ormerod&rsquo;s &ldquo;History of Cheshire,&rdquo; was but little
known to Chester antiquaries until the year 1849, when this city
was honoured with a visit from the British Arch&aelig;ological
Association.&nbsp; A vast amount of rubbish, the accumulation of
centuries, at that period blocked up the chamber; but the greater
part of it was removed at the expense of the Association, and an
able paper delivered on the subject, by Mr. Ashpitel, at their
Chester Congress.&nbsp; That gentleman pronounced it to be the
<i>Promptuarium</i>, or <i>Buttery</i> of the Abbey; but a room,
originally 105 feet long, seems of undue proportions for such a
purpose.&nbsp; Mr. W. F. Ayrton, Secretary of the Chester
Arch&aelig;ological Society, with greater apparent probability
conceives it to be the <i>secunda aula</i> of the Monastery, such
as we find described in the charter of Henry VIII.&nbsp; Here it
was that audience was given to strangers and dependants, and
where friends of the abbot were temporarily entertained during
their visits to the Monastery.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>The
wall of the obliterated south walk, notwithstanding the cloister
itself is &lsquo;no more,&rsquo; is yet not without interest to
the real lover of antiquity.&nbsp; Two rude arcades of late
Norman work stretch along this wall, the arches of which mark the
place of sepulture of four early abbots of the foundation.&nbsp;
Some of the bases of the pillars once supporting the roof of the
south walk are still visible on the Preese, or Cloister
Green.</p>
<p>Returning to the north walk, we pass thence, under a richly
ornamented arch, into another apartment on the right hand, now
and for three centuries past occupied as the <span
class="smcap">Grammar School</span> of the Cathedral.&nbsp; Few
portions of the conventual buildings are so little known to
visitors as the one we are now entering,&mdash;few will so amply
repay their inspection as will this, the ancient <span
class="smcap">Refectory</span> of this once famous
Monastery.&nbsp; Time was,</p>
<blockquote><p>And a gay time it was then, O!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>when this noble apartment, the <i>Frater House</i> of the
Abbey, re-echoed with the sounds of feast and revelry,&mdash;when
the monks of St. Werburgh, and their privileged friends,
discussed, in joyous mood, the good things of this life, dished
up to them from the kitchens and buttery of the Abbey.&nbsp;
Fancy how the tables groaned with the savoury venison and other
titbits from the granges of the abbot,&mdash;with the products of
their favourite kaleyards and fisheries,&mdash;and their wines
and liquors brought from beyond sea,&mdash;and say, if you think
these degenerate times can show aught to equal those palmy
days!&nbsp; After all, though</p>
<blockquote><p>Many have told of the monks of old,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What a saintly race they were;<br />
Yet &rsquo;tis most true that a merrier crew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Could scarce be found elsewhere.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For they sang and laughed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rich wine quaffed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lived on the daintiest fare.</p>
<p>And the Abbot meek, with his form so sleek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the heartiest of them all,<br />
And would take his place, with a smiling face,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When the <span class="smcap">Refectory</span> bell
would call;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And they sang and laughed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And the rich wine quaffed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Till they shook the olden hall!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say what you will of the austerities supposed to belong to the
monastic life, those recluses of old lived a life as jolly, as
careless, <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>and as free, as the gayest of us in this 19th
century!&nbsp; Yonder, at the head of that staircased recess in
the south wall, is the ancient Oratory, from which one of the
&lsquo;knights of the cowl&rsquo; daily &lsquo;said grace,&rsquo;
and pronounced a classic oration, while his brethren were at
meals in the spacious hall beneath him.&nbsp; Oh, what a sight
for carnal eyes like his to dwell and gloat upon!&nbsp; But we
must not soliloquise.&nbsp; The Fratry, or Refectory, in the days
we are describing, was of nobler dimensions even than now; for it
then extended some twenty or thirty feet farther westward, and
was doubtless shorn of its fair proportions at the time the
present road was constructed from the Abbey Square.&nbsp; This
room, which is 98 feet long and 34 feet high, has a range of six
pointed windows on the one side, and four on the other, and had
once an eastern lancet-shaped window of considerable
beauty.&nbsp; Of the window of the present day we forbear to
speak; simply let us hope that the hour is at hand, when so
hideous an abortion of all that is &ldquo;chaste and beautiful in
art&rdquo; shall vanish from the scene, and be replaced by a
window worthy of the apartment it was meant to adorn!&nbsp; The
steps leading up to the Oratory communicated originally with the
<span class="smcap">Dormitory</span> of the Abbey, which prior to
the present century occupied the higher range of the eastern
cloister, but has now entirely disappeared.</p>
<p>At the Reformation, when King Henry VIII. transformed the
Abbey into a Cathedral, he founded here, in the thirty-sixth year
of his reign, a <span class="smcap">Grammar School</span> for
twenty-four boys, and endowed it with a Head Master, and numerous
privileges, some of which it was <i>our</i> lot, twenty years
ago, personally to share.&nbsp; The history of the School, and of
the many Cheshire worthies educated within its walls, would
furnish matter for a distinct treatise, and it is not improbable
that such may one day appear from our humble pen.&nbsp; For the
present, then, we will retire from this scene of our
boyhood&rsquo;s delight, and ascending the range of steps near
the entrance door, emerge from the &ldquo;bosom of our spiritual
mother&rdquo; at a point very close to the head of Abbey
Street.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> smell of sanctity yet fresh
upon us, let us now continue, as best we may, our peregrinations
northward.</p>
<p>Yonder, at the lower end of this Street, we catch a glimpse of
the <span class="smcap">Walls</span>; and, turning ourselves
about, take a rapid look at <span class="smcap">Abbey
Square</span> (the only Square old Chester can boast!) with its
<span class="smcap">Deanery</span> and <span
class="smcap">Bishop&rsquo;s Palace</span>,&mdash;the former
occupying the site of the ancient <span class="smcap">Chapel of
St. Thomas</span>, nay, resting indeed on the foundations of that
sacred edifice.&nbsp; The latter is a gloomy-looking pile of red
sandstone, erected by Bishop Keene in 1753; but within it have
resided as goodly a fellowship of mitred heads as ever graced the
episcopal bench.&nbsp; Markham, Porteus, Cleaver, Law, Blomfield,
Sumner, and last not least, Graham, our present amiable diocesan,
have each in turn found here their house and home.</p>
<p>But what is this massive and substantial structure, under
which we are now passing,&mdash;so massive and strong as almost
to have defied the ravages of time?&nbsp; Behold in it the
principal <span class="smcap">Gateway</span> of the <span
class="smcap">Abbey</span>, an imposing edifice even in this our
day, but one which had seen the meridian of its splendour ere
Harry the Eighth, hypocritical Harry! sacrilegiously sealed and
decreed its doom.&nbsp; In those, its halcyon days, few gates
indeed might &ldquo;stand between the wind and its
nobility;&rdquo; for &lsquo;regal pomp and lordly retinue&rsquo;
sought ever and anon a welcome here.&nbsp; And not in vain: for
as we have already shown, when once its ponderous doors moved
back to give them ingress, the tables of the Refectory and the
<i>bonhommie</i> of the monks never failed to sustain the
hospitable character of the Abbey.&nbsp; Look up, through the
gloom, at the solid masonry of this ancient pile, and at the
admirable groining which supports the
superstructure;&mdash;gingerbread architecture was all unknown in
those medi&aelig;val times!&nbsp; On the west side of the <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>archway, we
can still see the rust-coated staples, on which, three or four
centuries ago, swang the oaken gates of the Abbey.&nbsp; Times
have changed; and the hoary old porter, with his shaven scalp,
and keys of &lsquo;trewyst steele,&rsquo; has flitted away from
the scene, while the tide of life now flows freely, and without
obstruction, &rsquo;neath this venerable Gate.&nbsp; Here, in
1554, it is traditionally said that <span class="smcap">George
Marsh</span>, a &lsquo;champion for the glorious truth,&rsquo;
was first imprisoned, preparatory to his trial and martyrdom at
the stake.&nbsp; And why,&mdash;what evil had he done?&nbsp; What
was &ldquo;the height and might of his offending?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Simply this,&mdash;that &ldquo;after the manner that man then
called heresy, so worshipped he the God of his
fathers.&rdquo;&nbsp; The <i>heretics</i> of one age are not
unfrequently the <i>saints</i> of another; and certain it is that
the memory of Marsh and the faith he died for, gained rather than
lost by those Marian fires!&nbsp; Not long afterwards, if not
indeed before, this structure was turned into the Episcopal <span
class="smcap">Registry</span>; and here are deposited, in its
well-kept archives, the &lsquo;last wills and testaments&rsquo;
of all who have died, and &lsquo;left aught to leave,&rsquo;
within the scattered limits of this widespread diocese.&nbsp; The
beautiful condition and systematic arrangement of these important
records put other and similar Offices terribly to the blush, and
are in the highest degree creditable to the zeal and ability of
the present Registrar, Henry Raikes, Esq. <a
name="citation96"></a><a href="#footnote96"
class="citation">[96]</a>&nbsp; Half a century or so ago, the
then deputy registrar was one Mr. Speed, a Joseph Andrews in his
way, though scarcely perhaps so free from guile as that
immaculate hero.&nbsp; Now it so happened that a frail daughter
of Eve had found her way into Master Speed&rsquo;s domain,
probably to administer to some <i>will</i> in his possession, or
for divers other &ldquo;urgent private affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp;
While thus engaged, a party from without required Mr.
Deputy&rsquo;s assistance; so locking the lady in the inner
office, he turned to attend to his unseasonable visitor.&nbsp;
Mademoiselle, finding herself immured, in so &ldquo;wilful&rdquo;
a manner, in this dusky prison, and having the remembrance of
<span class="smcap">Marsh</span> and his martyrdom in her mind,
became seriously alarmed.&nbsp; Having however, like most women,
a &ldquo;<i>will</i> of her own,&rdquo; she threw open the window
which looks into Abbey Square, and springing out of it like a
zephyr, quietly allowed herself to descend, buoyed up by her
flowing garments, to the ground below!&nbsp; Some waggish artist
has perpetuated the event in a characteristic sketch, displaying
the &ldquo;flight of the descending angel;&rdquo; to which <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>another
sarcastic genius, the late Mascie Taylor, Esq., added this
couplet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Since women are so fond of men,<br />
With <i>Speed</i> she will fly up again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us now pass on.</p>
<p>Leaving behind us the <span class="smcap">Abbey Gate</span>
and its bygone associations, we are once more in <span
class="smcap">Northgate Street</span>, and may stay to cast
&ldquo;one withering glance&rdquo; at those melancholy-looking
buildings on either side, the <span class="smcap">Fowl</span>,
<span class="smcap">Butter</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Butchers&rsquo; Markets</span> of the city.&nbsp;
Hideous as specimens of architectural taste, destitute of
convenience or comfort in use, furthermore heavy and cheerless to
look upon, these Markets have, of themselves, nothing to rivet
the attention of the sightseer.&nbsp; But the ground they stand
on was in old time an open area; and here, from the time of the
great Hugh Lupus to the glorious advent of the Reformation, did
the monks of St. Werburgh hold their annual <span
class="smcap">Fair</span> at the great feast of that saint.&nbsp;
It was during one of these fairs that Earl Randle was besieged in
Rhuddlan Castle by the Welsh, when attempting the subjugation of
those Cambrian mountaineers.&nbsp; The Earl, perceiving the nice
pickle he was in, despatched a messenger to De Lacy, his
constable at Chester, a &ldquo;ryght valiaunt manne,&rdquo; who,
rushing into the Fair, presently collected to his standard a
&ldquo;noble army of fiddlers&rdquo; and drunken
musicians&mdash;the &ldquo;tag, rag, and bobtail&rdquo; there
assembled&mdash;and with these he forthwith set out to the relief
of his beleagured lord.&nbsp; The Welsh, who had previously felt
sure of their prey, seeing the immense host approach, and hearing
withal the terrible discords of &ldquo;harp, flute, sackbut,
psaltery, and other kinds of music,&rdquo; reasonably enough
concluded that Bedlam was let loose; and with that doubtful sort
of valour sometimes nicknamed discretion, precipitately took to
their heels, and so raised the siege.&nbsp; The Earl returned to
Chester at the head of his victorious minstrels, and immediately
chartered the holding of this Fair with numerous privileges and
immunities, granting to the brave De Lacy, and to his heirs for
ever, the licensing of and custody over the &ldquo;Minstrels of
Cheshire;&rdquo; which prerogative was regularly exercised by his
descendants, until the middle of the last century.&nbsp; So much
for the <span class="smcap">Abbot&rsquo;s Fair</span>, and the
bloodless &ldquo;fight of the fiddlers;&rdquo;&mdash;we may now
&ldquo;fair&rdquo;-ly enough continue our course of
inspection.</p>
<p>Proceeding direct north, we come to another postern, now
ruinated, the mere arch itself alone remaining.&nbsp; This is the
<a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span><i>Little</i> or <i>Higher Abbey Gate</i>; and from it,
in days past, ran the wall of the Monastery in a direct line
southward to the Great <span class="smcap">Abbey Gate</span>; the
wall itself has now given way to a row of shops and other
valuable buildings.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite to the <i>Little Abbey Gate</i>, retiring
somewhat from the street, stands a neat, modern-built house; in
the courtyard of which we may see a handsome piece of statuary,
purchased by a former proprietor at the close of the French War:
it represents the British Lion,</p>
<blockquote><p>With tail erect and aspect terrible,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>trampling majestically on the Eagle of France,&mdash;typical
of the overthrow of the first Napoleon.&nbsp; Little did the
sculptor suppose, when he proudly chiselled &lsquo;that angry
mane, and tail of grim defiance,&rsquo; that the Lion and the
Eagle would so soon be united in such friendly bonds, nay even
fighting, side by side, the almost unaided battle of right
against might, justice against oppression!&nbsp; If that classic
group had to be sculptured anew&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Such are the strange mutations of the
world,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the prostrate Eagle might haply bear an additional head,
emblematical of the ruthless despoiler of Finland, the Caucasus,
and Poland!</p>
<p>In a step or two we are passing the higher end of <i>King
Street</i>, formerly <i>Barn Lane</i>, at the corner of which
stands an ancient hostelry, yclept the &ldquo;Pied
Bull.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here again we have before us the degenerate
type of those strange old Rows, which so filled you with amaze in
our earlier rambles.&nbsp; There can be no doubt that,
originally, these wondrous piazzas ran continuously along the
four great streets of the city, except where they verge upon the
confines of the Abbey; but these isolated portions are gradually
disappearing before the &ldquo;march of improvement.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Doctors differ, alas! in Chester, as elsewhere, about the actual
wisdom of this aforesaid &ldquo;march!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again we move onwards, passing under a substantial arch of
white stone, referred to in our &ldquo;Walk round the
Walls&rdquo; as the <span class="smcap">Northgate</span> of the
city.&nbsp; While the other three Gates were vested, by
serjeantship, from time immemorial, in various noble families,
this, the <i>porta septentrionalis</i>, as anciently belonged to
the commorant citizens.&nbsp; Prior to 1808, when the present
arch was erected, the <span class="smcap">Northgate</span>, if we
may credit the engravings handed <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>down to us, was a miserably effete
and incongruous erection.&nbsp; What made it appear more so was
the Gaol, or common prison of the city, which occupied a great
part of the space around, above, and below it.&nbsp; A prison
existed here from the earliest period; it is quoted in documents
of the Norman earldom, and was at the time of its demolition a
terrible specimen of legalised corruption&mdash;an establishment
defying even the besom of a Howard to purge or purify.&nbsp; The
city sheriff here saw execution done on all criminals capitally
convicted within the county; here again the unfortunate debtor
got &ldquo;whitewashed,&rdquo; and relieved of his &ldquo;little
odd scores;&rdquo; and here were practised those &ldquo;tortures
thrice refined&rdquo; which might put even the Great Inquisition
to the blush.&nbsp; Far away from human gaze, fathoms deep in the
solid rock, were chambers hewn, dreadful to survey, horrifying to
think upon.&nbsp; Of these, two bore the distinguishing titles of
&ldquo;Little Ease,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Dead Man&rsquo;s
Room.&rdquo;&nbsp; The latter was the spot where condemned
criminals awaited their execution, and was &ldquo;a dark stinking
place&rdquo; in which snakes and other venomous reptiles
gambolled at discretion.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Little Ease,&rdquo; as
we read from a contemporary work, &ldquo;was a hole hewed out in
a rock; the breadth and cross from side to side was seventeen
inches from the back to the inside of the great door; at the top
seven inches, at the shoulders eight inches, and at the breast
nine inches and a-half; with <i>a device to lessen the height</i>
as they were minded to torture the person put in, by drawboards
which shot over across the two sides, to a yard in height, or
thereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In those blissful times when Oliver Cromwell ruled England
with an iron sceptre, these two &ldquo;pleasantly situated
furnished apartments&rdquo; were in great request by the
Barebones magistracy; and it is matter of record that,</p>
<blockquote><p>Locked in their cold embrace,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>numerous unoffending, peaceloving Quakers endured the rod of
persecution for conscience sake.&nbsp; And yet, forsooth,
<i>those</i> were your oft-vaunted days of civil and religious
liberty!&nbsp; Away with them all, say we!&nbsp; The Gaol, with
its attendant miseries, has gone, but the dungeons we have
pictured abide there still, beneath the ground we are now
standing on,&mdash;though filled up, it is true, and for ever
absolved from their ancient uses.</p>
<p>Having just passed <i>under</i> one arch, we are now walking
<i>over</i> another which spans an abyss formed by the deep cut
of the <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>Ellesmere and Chester Canal.&nbsp; Yon little parallel
archway, a few yards to the westward of us, is the <i>Bridge of
Death</i>,&mdash;the path along which the felons about to die
usually went to receive the &ldquo;last consolation of the
church&rdquo; in the Chapel of St. John, on the opposite side of
the gulf.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Pass we on once more for a few yards, and then turning round,
a prospect awaits us the very similitude of that depicted in our
engraving.&nbsp; To the left we have the <span
class="smcap">Northgate</span>, and portion of the <span
class="smcap">Walls</span>&mdash;those rare old
Walls!&mdash;while the foreground to the right is occupied by
that useful charitable institution, the <span
class="smcap">Blue-Coat Hospital</span>.&nbsp; For centuries
prior to the great Civil War there stood, on this site, a
venerable asylum, founded by Randal, Earl of Chester, for
&ldquo;poore and sillie persons,&rdquo; under the name of the
<span class="smcap">Hospital of St. John the
Baptist</span>.&nbsp; In the reign of Edward III., a jury of free
citizens was sworn to report on the &ldquo;vested rights&rdquo;
of this house, and the verdict these worthies returned was
this:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>&ldquo;That there ought to be, and have accustomed to
be, in the said Hospital, three chaplains to say mass
daily&mdash;two in the church, and the third in the
chapel&mdash;before the poor and feeble sustained in the said
Hospital; and that one lamp ought to be sustained at mass every
day in the said Hospital, and to burn every night in the whole
year; and that thirteen beds, competently clothed, should be
sustained in the same Hospital, and receive thirteen poor men of
the same city; whereof each shall have for daily allowance a loaf
of bread, a dish of pottage, half a gallon of competent ale, and
a piece of fish or flesh, as the day shall require.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not bad fare this for the thirteen brethren, &ldquo;poore and
feeble,&rdquo; who, from all we can judge,</p>
<blockquote><p>Must have gone to bed merry (as who could
fail),<br />
On their foaming &ldquo;half-gallons of competent ale!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus matters sped with this thriving community for several
hundred years; and even at the Reformation, when other and
similar institutions foundered in the gale, St. John&rsquo;s
Hospital appears to have weathered the storm.&nbsp; It might,
indeed, have retained until now its original position, had not
England got entangled in that horrid Civil War.&nbsp; Then it was
that, with characteristic loyalty, the men of old Chester
declared for the king&mdash;then it was that the suburbs of the
city became a ruinous heap&mdash;and that this venerable Hospital
was razed to the ground, lest it should serve as a cover for the
artillery of the enemy.&nbsp; But the city, which had so bravely
withstood one foe, had, like the Kars of our own day, to succumb
before another; for famine at length achieved what the deadly
cannon had failed to accomplish!&nbsp; The tale of the <span
class="smcap">Siege</span> has already been told; suffice it then
to say, that order and the monarchy being once more restored, the
site of the Hospital, and the lands belonging to it, were granted
by Charles II. to Colonel Whitley, and at his death to the Mayor
and Corporation of Chester, as permanent custodians of the
charity.&nbsp; How the Corporation abused their trust, and
mismanaged the Hospital; how they sold its estates, and
squandered the proceeds; and how, after all, &ldquo;like leeches
satiate with evil blood,&rdquo; they had to disgorge their
plunder, is, we can assure you, a very pretty story, which we
might tell, if we chose, but we are mercifully inclined.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">A Blue-Coat Hospital</span> was
established in Chester in 1700, under the auspices of Bishop
Stratford; and, seventeen years <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>afterwards, the liberality of the
citizens erected in its service a &ldquo;local habitation,&rdquo;
on part of the site originally occupied by the Hospital of St.
John.&nbsp; But bricks and mortar, like everything else, will not
last for ever; so the old premises having gone to decay,
benevolence has again put its shoulder to the wheel, and, in
1854, restored the fabric in the handsome manner we now behold
it.&nbsp; That graceful little statue over the doorway&mdash;a
portrait of one of the &ldquo;Blue Boys&rdquo;&mdash;is a study
from the life by Richardson, of London.&nbsp; There are
thirty-one scholars on the foundation, all clothed, fed, boarded,
and educated at the cost of the charity; besides which, there is
a probationary or &ldquo;<span class="smcap">Green Cap&rdquo;
School</span>, from which those who have &ldquo;attained the
purple&rdquo; are usually selected.</p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;thirteen brethren, poore and feeble,&rdquo;
of the original foundation, their number, which, from causes
already hinted at, had dwindled down to six, has recently been
restored,&mdash;their cottages at the rear of the Blue School
rebuilt, and fitted with every convenience,&mdash;while each
brother and sister now receives an allowance of ten shillings per
week.&nbsp; Thus, thanks to Lord Brougham and his charity
commissioners, thirteen poor souls&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>From chilling want and guilty murmurs free,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>here rest their aged limbs; and as they, in turn, go down
peacefully to the grave, others will step into their shoes, to
the perpetual honour of the <span class="smcap">Hospital of St.
John</span>, and of its Norman founder, the good Earl Randal.</p>
<p>The steep lane running westward from the Hospital is <span
class="smcap">Canal Street</span>, leading down to the canal, and
the &ldquo;banks of the Dee.&rdquo;&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t care
about going down there, just now?&nbsp; Very well, then,
we&rsquo;ll refrain; but, uninviting as it seems at first sight,
a ramble upon the Navigation Cop, at the first flow of the tide,
is an enjoyable sort of treat, as you&rsquo;ll find if you have
time to avail yourself of it.</p>
<p>Nearly opposite to the Blue School is <span
class="smcap">George Street</span>, anciently called <i>Gorse
Stacks</i>, a wider and more commodious street than the last,
leading away to the Cattle Market and Railway Station, as also to
the populous and increasing suburb of <span class="smcap">New
Town</span>.&nbsp; We can remember this locality when it was
little else but green pasture&mdash;the <i>Lion&rsquo;s Field</i>
we believe it was called&mdash;but how changed is it now! its
verdure has fled,&mdash;it is country no longer; for the once
open fields now swarm with innumerable homes of men!&nbsp; Near
<a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>the
bottom of <span class="smcap">St. Ann Street</span>, the oldest
and still principal street of this suburb, stands <span
class="smcap">Christ Church</span>, a neat little cruciform
structure, with diminutive spire, and small lancet-shaped
windows, erected in 1838, to meet the spiritual wants of this
growing neighbourhood.&nbsp; The Church has sitting accommodation
for about 600 worshippers.</p>
<p>Proceeding along <span class="smcap">Upper Northgate
Street</span>, we soon reach Egerton House, formerly a seat of
the Cheshire family of that name; but recently converted into a
first-class ladies&rsquo; school, under the efficient management
of the Misses Williams.&nbsp; Stay here an instant, for we are
just over the <span class="smcap">Tunnel</span> of the Chester
and Holyhead Railway, which science, art, and convenience have
combined to make the great highway between England and
Ireland.</p>
<p>A little farther on, and our street branches off in two almost
parallel directions,&mdash;the way upon our right being the old
coach road to Birkenhead and Liverpool, and that upon our
left&mdash;but stay! we are travelling a &ldquo;leetle&rdquo; too
fast, for we haven&rsquo;t quite done with our present
<i>locale</i>.&nbsp; Before us stands a lofty house, crowned with
a lanthorn-shaped observatory, and at present the residence of
Mr. Fletcher.&nbsp; It occupies the site of an older house,
called at different periods <i>Green Hall</i> and
<i>Jolly&rsquo;s Hall</i>, destroyed before the Siege of Chester,
for the same reasons which dictated the fall of other portions of
the suburbs.&nbsp; This house, again, had usurped the place of an
older tenant of the soil; for here was situate the <span
class="smcap">Chapel</span> and <span
class="smcap">Cemetery</span> of <span class="smcap">St. Thomas
&agrave; Becket</span>, founded, no doubt, soon after that
prelate&rsquo;s murder and canonisation in 1170.&nbsp; This
Chapel gave name to the manorial court in connection with the
Abbey, to which jurisdiction the tenants of the Cathedral are
even now subject.&nbsp; Until lately, the bailiff of the Dean and
Chapter held his annual court for this manor in the Refectory
(now the King&rsquo;s School), impanelling his jury from among
the Cathedral tenants, who, by that &ldquo;suit and
service,&rdquo; acknowledged the prerogative of this ancient
court.&nbsp; Now let us pass on along the roadway to our
left.</p>
<p>What is this Elizabethan building we are so rapidly
approaching?&nbsp; Surely this has no antediluvian tale to
tell&mdash;no musty connection with medi&aelig;val times?&nbsp;
No, truly: here we have a creation of the present age&mdash;a
noble institution,&mdash;one which, from its character and
objects, deserves at least some notice at our hands.&nbsp; This
is the <span class="smcap">Diocesan Training College</span>, the
same building we saw and admired at a distance, in our
&ldquo;Walk round the Walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Erected mainly by
public subscription, in 1842, from <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>the designs of Messrs. Buckler, of
London&mdash;established for the training and qualifying of
masters for the Church Schools of the diocese,&mdash;presided
over by the bishop, and more immediately by the talented
principal, the Rev. Arthur Rigg,&mdash;this institution
&ldquo;pursues the even tenour of its way,&rdquo; by annually
preparing a number of young men fitted for the duties of
parochial schoolmasters&mdash;men firmly attached to the Church
of their forefathers, and able to impart to those intrusted to
them the blessings of a sound, religious, and useful
education.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">College</span> has a resident
principal and vice-principal, the former, Mr. Rigg, having held
his appointment since the first starting of the project.&nbsp; In
its infancy, and while the present handsome edifice was in
building, the <span class="smcap">College</span> for awhile
&ldquo;hid its light under a bushel&rdquo; in some dreary-looking
premises in Nicholas Street, but was removed hither in the autumn
of 1842.&nbsp; In addition to the ordinary details of scholastic
training, the students are instructed in various branches of
manual labour; they are taught how &ldquo;to handle the chisel
and the saw, the mattock and the spade.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have on
the premises a blacksmith&rsquo;s forge,&mdash;at which they
manufacture all their own implements and
tools;&mdash;turners&rsquo; lathes, steam-engines, lithographic
presses, power looms, and a host of other appliances, are at the
mercy of the &ldquo;happy family;&rdquo; and it is wonderful to
see to what proficiency these amateur craftsmen attain,&mdash;and
all, be it remembered, during their intervals of leisure from
more important duties.&nbsp; Subordinate in some measure to this
&ldquo;school for school-masters,&rdquo; there is also a Lower
School, upon the ground floor, for the children of the
poor.&nbsp; Here the incipient masters in turn officiate, and
gradually learn, under the superintendence of their worthy chief,
the practical duties of their responsible profession.&nbsp; Under
the same paternal roof exists another school, more private and
commercial in its character and aims, under the special eye and
control of the principal, for the sons of the higher and middle
classes of society.&nbsp; Of this latter arm it is sufficient to
say&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>And higher praise &rsquo;twere hard to give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unjust to offer less,&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>that it is conducted on the same scale of intelligence and
liberality which distinguish the other main branches of the
institution.</p>
<p>Some years after the building of the <span
class="smcap">College</span>, a Chapel was erected at the
south-east corner, for the use of the students; and a chaste
little edifice it is, inside as well as out; worthy&mdash;if
aught <a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>here below, indeed, <i>can</i> be worthy&mdash;of the
holy purpose for which it was designed,&mdash;the glorious
worship of the triune God.&nbsp; The internal fittings and
decorations, which are many and beautiful, are almost wholly the
work of the industrious students; and, while honourable to their
taste in design, reflect the highest credit as well upon their
hearts as on their hands.</p>
<p>Beyond, and to the right of the <span
class="smcap">College</span>, stands the Cheshire <span
class="smcap">County Lunatic Asylum</span>; but, this being
without the confines of the City, is, by the same token, beyond
our pale.</p>
<p>We have now reached the extent of our wanderings northward,
for a narrow brook, a short distance away, determines the limits
of the city jurisdiction; so, bidding &ldquo;a long, a last
farewell&rdquo; to the Chester <span
class="smcap">College</span>, and to the enchanting prospect its
site commands, we will return, nothing loth, to the heart of the
city, and to those ravishing chops so anxiously awaiting us at
our own hotel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">What</span> a strange old place this <span
class="smcap">Chester</span> of ours is!&nbsp; As we retrace our
steps under the <span class="smcap">Northgate</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Walls</span>, we seem as if roaming through a
city of the middle ages; so oddly does everything around us
arrest our attention, and &ldquo;excite our passing
wonder.&rdquo;&nbsp; Those overhanging gables, with darksome
pathways burrowed out beneath them, and whose builders were
subjects of &ldquo;Good Queen Bess,&rdquo;&mdash;those two rugged
Gateways still marking the course of the old Abbey
wall,&mdash;the crumbling Abbey itself, more venerable still, and
incomparably &ldquo;richer and rarer&rdquo; to look upon; these,
and yon marvellous Rows, which nobody has ever seen, or ever can
see, anywhere but in Chester, afford us ample subjects for
contemplation until we arrive at the <span
class="smcap">Eastgate</span>.</p>
<p>The first street we come to on leaving the Gate is <span
class="smcap">St. John Street</span>; but, the good old rule of
&ldquo;first come, first serve,&rdquo; must for once be set
aside, since we intend to reserve the locality for the close of
the present chapter.</p>
<p>Just opposite to St. John Street, is Bank Place; the house at
the top of which was long the residence of Richard Llwyd, the
Bard of Snowdon, and the author of &ldquo;Beaumaris Bay,&rdquo; a
zealous, amiable, and intelligent Welsh antiquary.&nbsp; The poet
died here in 1835.</p>
<p>Moving away eastward, then, past the end of <span
class="smcap">Frodsham Street</span>, already noticed on our way
from the <span class="smcap">Railway Station</span>, we discern,
upon our left, a long passage, leading up to the <span
class="smcap">Commercial Hall</span>; and, on the right, a heavy
block of buildings, one hundred and sixty feet long by ninety-two
feet wide, rejoicing in the name of the <span class="smcap">Union
Hall</span>.&nbsp; These <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>Halls were erected, the former in
1815, and the latter in 1809, by the Lancashire and Yorkshire
merchants, who used formerly to inundate the city with their
wares during the continuance of the two great Chester Fairs, in
October and July.&nbsp; When first built, these &ldquo;marts of
foreign commerce&rdquo; were always thronged at the privileged
season with both buyers and sellers; but the world is wiser than
it was; and even the Cestrians have discovered that one of the
worst things they can buy is &ldquo;a pig in a poke;&rdquo; and
that their own tradesmen sell articles every whit as cheap and as
good as did those itinerant pedlars.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Not far from the Union Hall is the old <i>Tennis</i> or
<i>Ball Court</i>, where Perm the Quaker once preached to his
admirers, and which was afterwards occupied as a <span
class="smcap">Theatre</span>, until the perversion of St.
Nicholas&rsquo; Chapel (now the <span class="smcap">Music
Hall</span>) to the like use.&nbsp; Here the productions of
&ldquo;rare Ben Jonson,&rdquo; and the &ldquo;immortal
Will,&rdquo; together with the minor frivolities of Congreve,
Cibber, and <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Vanbrugh (the latter of whom is claimed as a native of
Chester), were doled forth to the patrons of &ldquo;the
legitimate drama.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chester is now destitute of a
Theatre; but whether it has suffered materially by the loss,
shall be left, so far at least as we are concerned, an open
question.</p>
<p>A little farther, upon the left hand, lies <span
class="smcap">Queen Street</span>; its higher or northern portion
being anciently known as the <i>Justing Croft</i>.&nbsp; Beyond
the mere name, history has bequeathed us no record of this spot;
but, though England&rsquo;s bard has tritely enough
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in a name?&rdquo; there is
something in <i>this</i> one of more than ordinary
significance.&nbsp; It is clear that at one time this was the
mimic field on which the youthful chivalry of Chester wielded the
lance, battle-axe, and sword; that this was the proud arena
where, after their return from the wars of Palestine and of
France, the belted knights of Cheshire tried a friendly lance
with each other, in the presence of their assembled sweethearts
and dames; and here, at &ldquo;tilt and tourney,&rdquo; met the
would-be champions of their county, the Calveleys, the Dones, the
Egertons, and the Cholmondeleys, and, mayhap, too, the
Grosvenors, the Warburtons, and the Leghs.&nbsp; We could
weave&mdash;but we won&rsquo;t, for our time is getting
short&mdash;a page or two of romance about this once favourite
haunt.&nbsp; Let us hurry away, then, first casting a glance at
two Chapels in this street&mdash;opposition establishments, but
near neighbours withal,&mdash;the <span class="smcap">Roman
Catholic Chapel</span>, lately transformed into a Cathedral; and
the larger and much handsomer meeting-house of the Calvinists, or
<span class="smcap">Independents</span>.</p>
<p>Once again in Foregate Street, we are soon at the head of
<span class="smcap">Love Lane</span>; why so named is a mystery;
at all events, its mission of love is now confined to the
manufacture of <i>tobacco-pipes</i>.&nbsp; At its eastern corner
is a handsome house, with spacious area in front, until lately
the city residence of the Barnstons of Crewe Hill, a Cheshire
family of high lineage and repute.&nbsp; In the area before this
house, March 19, 1804, the colours were presented to the <i>Loyal
Cheshire Volunteers</i>, by the lady of Colonel Barnston,
commanding officer of the corps.&nbsp; The house is now converted
into the <span class="smcap">Auction Mart</span> of the Messrs.
Churton, the knock of whose professional hammer vibrates at
intervals through its noble rooms.</p>
<p>Onward again past <span class="smcap">Seller Street</span>,
and the Octagon Chapel, where the Reverend John Wesley once
preached, we are not long arriving at a steep road upon our right
hand, called <i>Dee Lane</i>, running down to the river
side.&nbsp; Near the head of this lane stood an ancient Gateway,
stretching right across the main street, bearing <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the name of
<span class="smcap">The Bars</span>.&nbsp; From a curious plan of
the city in the reign of Elizabeth, this Gateway appears to have
had a circular turret on either side; but no trace of these
remained at the time of its demolition in 1770.&nbsp; From the
Bars extended, to the left and right, the outer line of
fortifications which encompassed the city during the period of
the <span class="smcap">Siege</span>.</p>
<p>Once clear of the Bars, we have passed into Boughton, having
Russell, Steam-Mill, and Stevens Streets, all upon our left
hand.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Steam-Mill Street</span>,
anciently <i>Horn Lane</i>, derives its present name from the
large <span class="smcap">Steam Corn-Mills</span> of Messrs.
Frost and Sons, occupying the whole of the northern portion of
the street.&nbsp; This is a mammoth establishment, employing a
large number of hands, and has been long and successfully carried
on by the present proprietors.&nbsp; The premises were destroyed
by fire in 1834.&nbsp; Close to these Mills flows the <span
class="smcap">Canal</span>, on the opposite side of which we have
a prospect of another hive of industry, the <span
class="smcap">Lead Works</span> and <span class="smcap">Shot
Tower</span> of Messrs. Walker, Parker and Co., already noticed
in our earlier rambles.</p>
<p>Returning to the main street, we soon arrive, through
&ldquo;poverty, hunger, and dirt,&rdquo; at <i>Hoole Lane</i>,
the corner of which is now embellished with a neat little
structure, known as the Chester <span class="smcap">Ragged
Schools</span>, for the use of those tattered little specimens of
humanity ever found about the streets of all populous towns.</p>
<p>The Street widens out at this point, disclosing, upon our left
hand, <span class="smcap">Richmond Terrace</span>, a row of
handsome suburban residences with neat gardens in front,
overlooking the Dee and the Welsh side of Cheshire,</p>
<blockquote><p>A prospect fair, of river, wood, and vale,<br />
As ever eye could wish for!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The declivity on the right is called <i>Gallows Hill</i>, from
its being of old time the place where malefactors paid the sad
penalty of their misdeeds.&nbsp; But what is this white
conventicle-looking edifice which crowns its heights?&nbsp;
Surely it is the refuge of some Mormon congregation&mdash;the
temple, perchance, of some pagan fanaticism?&nbsp; Nay verily,
good sirs,&mdash;assuage your indignation, for this is a Church
of your own communion, a sort of Chapel of Ease to the parish of
St. John.&nbsp; The architect was &ldquo;abroad&rdquo; when this
building was designed; for one less becoming the outward
character of a Church it is impossible to conceive.&nbsp; It is
dedicated to <span class="smcap">St. Paul</span>, and was opened
for divine worship in 1830.</p>
<p>Some twenty or thirty yards farther the road divides in
twain&mdash;<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>that upon the left being the great highway to Nantwich
and London in the days when &ldquo;<i>flying</i> machines&rdquo;
went hence to the metropolis in <i>a couple of
days</i>!&mdash;the disciples of Watt are now ready to convey us
thither in six or seven hours!&nbsp; The right-hand road would
lead us to Whitchurch and Shrewsbury, if we wanted to go there;
but we have not yet done with &ldquo;rare old
Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; This little plot of land on the right is
extra-parochial, forming part of that ancient Hospital for
<i>Lepers</i>, the ancient lazar-house of St. Giles.&nbsp; In the
&rsquo;<span class="smcap">Spital</span>, as it is now by
corruption called, George Marsh was burnt for his firm adherence
to the Protestant faith in the days of Queen Mary; and in the
little Cemetery of this Hospital, near which we are standing, his
calcined remains now quietly rest &ldquo;in sure and certain
hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Beyond this lies the township of <span class="smcap">Great
Boughton</span>, and a Chapel, once presided over by the Rev. P.
Oliver, a somewhat celebrated nonconformist divine.&nbsp; Near
this Chapel, in 1821, a Roman Altar was dug up, in splendid
preservation, and about four feet high, bearing the following
inscription:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">NYMPHIS ET FONTIBUS</span><br />
<span class="GutSmall">LEG.&nbsp; XX.&nbsp; V.V.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>the which, being translated, would in English read
thus&mdash;&ldquo;To the Nymphs and Fountains, the 20th Legion,
the invincible and victorious.&rdquo;&nbsp; So much for <span
class="smcap">Boughton</span>, and its past and present
condition; we will now retrace our steps to the head of <span
class="smcap">St. John Street</span>.</p>
<p>Moving rapidly down this street, leaving behind us the <span
class="smcap">Post Office</span>, and the entrance to the
Blossoms Assembly Room, we pause before a house on our
right-hand, approached by a flight of steps, and having a lofty
stuccoed front.&nbsp; This is the <span
class="smcap">Mechanics&rsquo; Institution</span>, and is
consecrated to the instruction and healthy amusement of that
important class of society whose name it bears.&nbsp; In addition
to a Library, comprising several thousand volumes, this
Institution enjoys the advantages of a News-Room, liberally
supplied with the leading daily and weekly papers; together with
sundry classes for the special behoof and instruction of the
members.&nbsp; During the summer months also, members have the
right of free admission to the <span class="smcap">Water Tower
Museum</span>, which we described at some length in our
&ldquo;Walk round the Walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; What a marvellous fact
it is, that with these benefits within their reach so few
mechanics, comparatively, avail themselves of this, <i>their
own</i> Institution!</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Beyond this lie the Schools and minister&rsquo;s house
of the Wesleyan Methodists, divided only by a path to the Walls
from the <span class="smcap">Wesleyan Chapel</span> itself.&nbsp;
The principles of Wesleyanism found their way into Chester as
early as 1760, the first congregation being held at a house in
Love Lane.&nbsp; Fifteen years afterwards, the Octagon Chapel in
Foregate Street was erected for them, and continued to be their
place of worship until the completion of the present edifice in
1811.</p>
<p>But what is there to see within those large folding-doors at
the bottom of St. John Street?&nbsp; Are any <i>Roman remains</i>
to be met with in there?&nbsp; Yes, indeed; but far different, in
every point of view, from those we have hitherto been
exploring.&nbsp; This is a <i>noli me tangere</i> domain; for the
elegant mansion and grounds of <span class="smcap">Dee
House</span> have recently developed, &rsquo;neath the double
enchantment of money and zeal, into a <span
class="smcap">Convent</span> of Nuns.&nbsp; Of the constitution
and management of this veiled religious order we are not
competent to speak, our sympathies being allied unto quite
another creed: but from the specimens we have seen flitting
noiselessly about the streets, we may but little expect to hear
any of them singing&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, what a pity such a pretty girl as I<br />
Should be pent in a Nunnery to weep and to cry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us leave then these recluses to the quiet enjoyment of
their lot,&mdash;whether it be the nursing of the sick, the
feeding of the hungry, or the schooling of the ignorant children
of their communion,&mdash;and, &ldquo;pursuing the even tenour of
our way,&rdquo; move quickly forward along <span
class="smcap">Little St. John Street</span>.&nbsp; The little row
of Almshouses erected by Mrs. Salmon in 1738&mdash;the premises
of Messrs. Royle and Son, builders&mdash;and the resuscitated
fabric of <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s House</span>,
almost destroyed by fire in the summer of 1855, will each in
their turn salute us on our progress, until the eye rests subdued
before the silent grandeur of the <span class="smcap">Church of
St. John</span>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s</span> is the only Church
with any pretensions to antiquity now left to the city outside
the Walls,&mdash;the minor fanes of St. Thomas, St. John the
Less, and St. Giles, having each disappeared &rsquo;neath the
hand of the destroyer during the great Civil War.&nbsp; In Roman
and early Saxon times the land to the southeast of the city, on
both sides the Dee, was most probably a forest&mdash;the home of
the wild deer, the fox, and the wolf&mdash;the genius of
civilisation finding ample field for employment within <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>the
Walls.&nbsp; In those latter days, Ethelred, son of Penda, being
king over Mercia, and withal an amiable and pious prince,</p>
<blockquote><p>Myndynge moost the blysse of Heuen,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>journeyed towards Chester, on a visit, it may be, to his
virgin niece, the holy St. Werburgh, then Abbess of
Chester.&nbsp; While there, we are told that, being admonished by
God in a vision &ldquo;to build a Church on the spot where he
should find a white hind,&rdquo; the king and his nobles engaged
in the chace, and straightway coming upon a white hind at this
very place, the royal hunter, in 689, founded and erected the
Saxon <span class="smcap">Church of St. John the
Baptist</span>.&nbsp; A more beautiful site for the erection of
such a Church could scarcely have been chosen.&nbsp; Seated on an
eminence overlooking the river Dee,&mdash;the rock it rests on
washed by a stream of far nobler proportions than the river of
<i>our</i> day,&mdash;its banks studded with prim&aelig;val
woods, above which, and far beyond, the peaks of the Cambrian
hills just showed their giant heads,&mdash;the yet nearer
mountain ranges of Beeston and Peckforton,&mdash;the city itself,
engirdled by the Walls of their Roman predecessors,&mdash;such
was the prospect that gladdened the eyes of the good King
Ethelred and the chaste Werburga, as they watched the progress of
their newly-founded Church.</p>
<p>What were the actual dimensions of the Saxon <span
class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s</span> is now, and must ever
remain a mystery;&mdash;whether any and what portion of the
present edifice may be properly referred back to that remote age
is, in like manner, doubtful.&nbsp; There are, however, many who
believe, like ourselves, that much of the older work, here and
there perceptible, belongs to a period anterior to the Norman
conquest.&nbsp; The brothers Lysons, (no mean authority,
you&rsquo;ll say) pronounce much of the nave and east end of the
church to be late Saxon work&mdash;portions, no doubt, of the
structure re-edified by Leofric, Earl of Mercia, in 1057.&nbsp;
Originally the steeple was in the centre of the Church, at the
point where the transept intersects the nave; but in or about
1468, it suddenly gave way, and destroyed in its fall great part
of the choir and east end of the Church.&nbsp; This tower was
soon after rebuilt, and another erected at the west end of the
nave:&mdash;the former again fell in 1572, and this time the
parishioners declined to restore it.&nbsp; The west steeple
shared a similar fate in 1574, destroying the whole of that
extremity of the fabric.&nbsp; Look up, from our present position
at the Gateway of the Churchyard, and the effects <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>of this
mishap will be at once apparent,&mdash;the steeple, one hundred
and fifty feet high, stands isolated from the main body of the
Church, that portion broken in by the fall having since been
suffered to remain so by the authorities of the parish.&nbsp; If
we pass round to the west side of the tower, we shall see midway
a canopied niche, in which stands the statue of the abbot king
Ethelred, caressing at his side the &ldquo;white hind&rdquo; of
his vision.&nbsp; This statue originally decorated the centre
tower; but being found <i>miraculously unhurt</i> amongst the
heap of rubbish created by that structure in its fall, was
removed by the parishioners to its present lofty and dignified
position.&nbsp; This steeple enjoys a set of eight peerless
bells, by far the most melodious of their kind in the city.&nbsp;
Six were cast in 1710, and the other two in 1734, having replaced
an older peal, which existed here at least as early as the reign
of Henry VII.&nbsp; Doubtless, therefore, during the great Civil
War, when the news of a royalist victory reached the ears of the
loyal citizens,</p>
<blockquote><p>Merrily, merrily rang the bells,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bells of St. John&rsquo;s church tower.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And &ldquo;merrily, merrily&rdquo; ring they still, as the
bridal procession issues from the porch, as well as on days of
public rejoicing&mdash;whenever, in fact, loyalty, love, or
patriotism need their witching strains.&nbsp; So much for the
outside of <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s
Church</span>,&mdash;now for a hasty glance at the interior.</p>
<p>Passing through the &ldquo;old church porch,&rdquo; adorned
with an arch of most beautiful character, the mouldings of which
spring from little delicately formed shafts, we enter the sacred
edifice at its north-western extremity.&nbsp; Here a prospect
awaits us enough to disgust even an out and out Puritan.&nbsp;
Hideous galleries of giant build, through which the light of
heaven can scarcely find its way,&mdash;long rows of high wooden
boxes, by those in authority facetiously termed
pews!&mdash;curtains of green exclusiveness, separating the rich
from their brethren the poor&mdash;such, alas! are our first
impressions of this venerable Church!&nbsp; With such incentives
to drowsiness, no wonder the parishioners are so sleepy about
their Church, and so painfully apathetic about its much-needed
restoration!</p>
<p>Threading our way, so well as we can in the gloom, to the
bottom of the centre aisle, we now begin to see, despite these
grievous drawbacks, something of the original glory and
magnificence <a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
114</span>of this ancient fabric.&nbsp; Following the line of
sight eastward, we feast our eyes on the massive pillars and
horse-shoe arches of the Saxon, or it may be early Norman
architect:&mdash;noble ideas of strength and symmetry had the
builder of those days!&nbsp; Above these, the double Triforium of
later work stretches along the whole length of the Nave, giving
to it an elegance and variety claimed for no other sacred edifice
in Cheshire.&nbsp; Originally the Nave was just double its
present length, boasting eight of those massive semicircular
arches on either side, of which four only now remain,&mdash;the
other four vanished &rsquo;neath the crash of the western
steeple.</p>
<p>Having arrived at the east end of the Nave, we find ourselves
standing between the four lofty piers which, previous to its
demolition, supported the great central tower.&nbsp; At this
point the transept divides the nave from the choir, and though
shorn of its fair proportions by modern reparations wholly devoid
of taste, yet contains enough of the original work to give us an
idea of its ancient grandeur.&nbsp; Eastward lay the
Choir,&mdash;now for the most part in ruins, and shut out from
the present Church by an interpolated window of very moderate
pretensions.&nbsp; The space beneath this window, once part of
the choir, has now become, consequent on these alterations, the
Chancel of St. John&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>To the right of the Chancel is another horse-shoe arch of very
early work, disclosing, behind, a &ldquo;fayre chappell,&rdquo;
once the burial place of the Warburtons, an ancient Cheshire
family.&nbsp; A fine sketch of this Chapel, in his own masterly
style, will be found in that now scarce work, Prout&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Antiquities of Chester.&rdquo;&nbsp; The floor is strewed
with a number of incised slabs, discovered at various periods in
the church or churchyard: three of these have been illustrated by
Mr. Boutell, in his valuable works on the history of Christian
Monuments.&nbsp; On the opposite side of the Chancel rests a
sculptured slab, bearing the recumbent effigy of an ecclesiastic,
robed in the chesuble and other priestly vestments of the
thirteenth or fourteenth century.&nbsp; The slab, which is
somewhat defaced, and without inscription, was found, in December
1855, some feet below the surface, on removing the house on the
east side of the porch.&nbsp; This is the third or fourth relic,
of a similar character, rescued from destruction by the
intelligent zeal of the present rector, the Rev. W. B.
Marsden.&nbsp; To the left is the Vestry; and near by,
ignominiously stowed away in a corner, lies the crosslegged
figure of a warrior, of the twelfth century perhaps, clad wholly
in mail, and supposed to represent a redoubtable <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>hero of the
Carrington family.&nbsp; Close beside, but totally unconnected
with it, lies another incised slab, commemorating one of whom all
we know is that inscribed on the stone itself, &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Hic jacet Johennes le Serjaun</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Most modern &ldquo;Guide&rdquo;-mongers have ignorantly supposed
the mailed figure adjoining to be this <i>Johennes le
Serjaun</i>; but this is an error, for the two relics were dug up
in different parts of the churchyard!&nbsp; Numerous other
monuments, of more or less interest, lie scattered around; but as
we are now arrived at the north chancel door, we will bid adieu
to the interior of <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s</span>,
and again emerge into the open air.</p>
<p>In the graveyard before us, to the left of what was originally
the extreme north of the Transept, stood until the last century
an ancient house, called the <i>Woolstaplers&rsquo; Hall</i>, of
which all trace has now passed away.&nbsp; Over the churchyard
wall we can see the upper portion of the <span
class="smcap">Grosvenor School</span>, a charitable institution,
erected and endowed by the first Lord Westminster, but now
supported by voluntary contributions.&nbsp; Farther still to the
right is the Rectory House, abutting upon Love Street and
Barker&rsquo;s Lane, neither of which possesses any charms for us
sightseers.</p>
<p>Turning away to the right from the Church door, a few paces
will bring us to a decayed and half-ruined wall, in the centre of
which is a small pointed arch, known as the entrance-gate to the
<span class="smcap">Priory</span>.&nbsp; This arch originally
formed part of the <i>Nunnery of St. Mary</i>, near the <span
class="smcap">Castle</span>, and was placed in its present
position on the demolition of the ruins of the former
establishment, about thirty years ago.&nbsp; The ground within
is, strictly speaking, private; but permission being courteously
afforded to visitors, we will quietly step into the interior, and
ponder awhile on the scene which now presents itself.&nbsp; The
genius of desolation reigns dominant here; this spot, once the
holiest of holies, the <i>sanctum sanctorum</i> of the Church of
St. John, is now a roofless and floorless waste.&nbsp; We are
standing on the site of the original choir, whose walls oft
resounded with purest melody:&mdash;but where <i>now</i> are the
white-robed train?&nbsp; The occupation of the chorister is
gone&mdash;the voice of the priest has hence for ever died away,
and the hymn of praise, of matin and evensong, no longer echoes
along its richly vaulted aisles!&nbsp; Here we see the effects
produced by the fall of the centre steeple, in 1470, and again in
1572, laying the whole east end of the structure in ruins.&nbsp;
Yet still, amid the general decay, for everything here seems
crumbling into dust, the rich old chancel arch (call it Saxon or
Norman, whichever you will) maintains erect <a
name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 116</span>its
venerable crest,&mdash;the ivy that clasps it, the trees that
overshadow, the mould that corrupts it, serving but to increase
and develop its charms.&nbsp; Passing under the arch, we are
straightway in the Chancel, and close to the spot where the high
altar of <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s</span> of old time
stood.&nbsp; Here, it may be, the censor of the priest wafted
aloft the incense at the daily sacrifice;&mdash;here the
anathemas of the church were pronounced against excommunicated
sinners;&mdash;and yet, here, after a lapse of some four hundred
years, rank weeds and grass now desecrate the ground, while the
owl and the bat hold their midnight levies in this once
&ldquo;holy place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Cast your eyes o&rsquo;er that
fragment heap, now formed into a sort of rockery,&mdash;every
stone there, could it but speak, has its tale to tell;&mdash;here
a shattered niche, there a sepulchral slab, yonder a broken font,
there again an image defaced&mdash;all rich and glorious in their
time, but surrendered now to undeserved decay!&nbsp; Pass we on
into one of the chapels, where high up in the wall, snugly housed
within <a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>the masonry, stands an ancient oak coffin bearing the
appropriate inscription of</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Dust to Dust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The Priory House was built on the ruins of the priests&rsquo;
houses, but has of itself no other claim to our notice, being
little in character with aught else around.&nbsp; Thus, then,
have we inspected these venerable ruins, so typical of the vanity
of everything human; let us now, all unwilling, tear ourselves
away,</p>
<blockquote><p>And thence returning, soothly swear,<br />
Was never scene so sad and fair!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the best general idea of the Church and Ruins is
obtained from yonder gateway at the east end of the yard, where
the eye embraces the whole at one view.&nbsp; During the Siege of
Chester, <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s Church</span> was
taken and garrisoned by the puritans.</p>
<p>From hence we proceed along a narrow pathway to the right,
turning round, as we do so, to take a last fond look at the south
side of the Ruins, which, from whatever point viewed, are
distinguished alike for their sublimity and beauty.&nbsp;
Slightly to the westward, on this side of the Church, stood
formerly the <i>Chapel of St. James</i>, which the brothers
Lysons assert was the original parish church.&nbsp; If this be
true, it was probably while St. John&rsquo;s was the Cathedral of
the united sees of Lichfield, Coventry, and Chester; in which
case <i>St. James&rsquo;s</i> must have been even of greater
antiquity than the present Church of St. John.&nbsp; There is now
no trace existing of this venerable Chapel.&nbsp; Yon block of
buildings at the extreme west of the churchyard is known as <span
class="smcap">Dee Side</span>, and the two mansions comprising it
were erected on the site of the Bishop&rsquo;s Palace and Deanery
of the episcopal foundation.</p>
<p>From thence a flight of steps leads down to the <span
class="smcap">Groves</span>, near a spring of great repute,
called <span class="smcap">Jacob&rsquo;s Well</span>; over which
is engraved the warning of Christ to the woman of Samaria,</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoso drinketh of this water shall thirst
again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving along to the eastward, we see a curious old house,
crowning the edge of the cliff on the left, and known as the
<i>Anchorite&rsquo;s Cell</i>.&nbsp; Here it is traditionally
affirmed that King Harold, merely wounded, not killed, at the
Battle of Hastings, was conveyed by his friends, and lived the
life of a hermit for several years.&nbsp; This is an article <a
name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 118</span>of faith
which you may believe or reject, as the spirit moves you; for
ourselves, we are tainted with the leaven of unbelief!</p>
<p>Passing <span class="smcap">Queen&rsquo;s Park Hotel</span>,
at the foot of the Suspension Bridge, we see the rich
<i>Grove</i> of trees which has given to the present locality its
name.&nbsp; We are now close to the river side, and feeling,
moreover, somewhat tired with our long walk; let us, therefore,
with appetites sharpened by exercise, step into the <span
class="smcap">Deva</span>, a handsome <span
class="smcap">Hotel</span> overlooking the river, and lay violent
siege to its well-stored larder.&nbsp; Take care to lay in a
plentiful stock of both liquids and solids ere you quit the
Hotel,&mdash;and, &ldquo;would you know the reason
why?&rdquo;&nbsp; Our next chapter will treat us to a &ldquo;Row
on the <span class="smcap">Dee</span>,&rdquo; and a visit to
<span class="smcap">Eaton Hall</span>,&mdash;neither of which, as
you&rsquo;ll presently see, are feats to be accomplished on an
empty stomach!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> finished our repast at the

meet with its equal!), we are now fully charged for a &ldquo;Row

&ldquo;red, white, and blue&rdquo; of old England, is the craft

oarsmen, and arranging the cushions and seats for our reception,

<p>Rising in Merionethshire, not far from Dolgelley, a modest
little rivulet, fed by a score of tributary brethren, elbows its
way through many a chasm and rocky dell, until it reaches <span
class="smcap">Bala Lake</span>.&nbsp; We have so far been tracing
a mere mountain stream; but gathering strength and increased
impetuosity as it passes through the centre of this beautiful
Lake, our little Welsh brook, twin sister of the Wnion, developes
into a River, and henceforward assumes the &ldquo;local
habitation and name&rdquo; of the <span
class="smcap">Dee</span>.&nbsp; Still, as from its source, a pure
Welsh river, the &ldquo;Druid stream of Deva&rdquo; gambols
cheerily on, through the rich Vale of Corwen, &rsquo;neath the
frowning ruins of <i>Castell Dinas Bran</i>, by the side of the
beautiful Abbey of <span class="smcap">Valle Crucis</span>, and
so through <span class="smcap">Llangollen</span>, &ldquo;that
sweetest of vales.&rdquo;&nbsp; Winding its way thence, through
Overton and Bangor,&mdash;the latter the scene of the massacre of
the British monks,&mdash;our river proceeds by a series of
zigzags on its course towards <span class="smcap">Holt</span>;
before reaching which, it serves as the boundary line between
Denbighshire and Cheshire.&nbsp; On the Welsh side of the river
stand the town and castle of <span class="smcap">Holt</span>, an

<span class="smcap">Farndon</span>, connected with Holt by an
ancient stone bridge; and from this, the <span

on its way to <span class="smcap">Chester</span> and the Irish

<p>But see; &ldquo;our bark is by the shore,&rdquo; and the
boatmen are awaiting us; let us, then, take our seats beneath its
awning, and launching out into the stream, cast a momentary
glance at the landscape behind us.&nbsp; In the foreground is the
<span class="smcap">Deva</span>, &ldquo;our marine Hotel,&rdquo;
half hidden from view by yon rich Grove of trees stretching along
the river&rsquo;s edge.&nbsp; Behind, and far above it, the tower
of <span class="smcap">St. John&rsquo;s Church</span> proudly
shows its rugged form.&nbsp; To the left is the Queen&rsquo;s
Park Suspension Bridge, more particularly noticed in our
&ldquo;Walk round the Walls.&rdquo;&nbsp; Away under the Bridge
we can see a small portion of the <span
class="smcap">Walls</span> near the Wishing Steps; and beyond
that, again, the <span class="smcap">Dee Mills</span> and <span
class="smcap">Bridge</span>, of ancient fame.&nbsp; Talking of
the Dee Mills, of course you know <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>the song, the rare old song, of the
&ldquo;Miller of the Dee,&rdquo;&mdash;that &ldquo;miller hale
and bold,&rdquo; the burden of whose song</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For ever used to be,&mdash;<br
/>
I envy nobody, no, not I!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And nobody envies me!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How few millers there are, who can say as much nowadays!</p>
<p>At length we are off, at a stately pace, for
&ldquo;steady&rsquo;s the word,&rdquo; in a Chester barge, and
soon we leave the <span class="smcap">Groves</span> and the
Queen&rsquo;s Park Villas behind us in the distance.&nbsp; Having
rounded Aikman&rsquo;s Gardens, we are opposite the grounds of
the <span class="smcap">Royal Chester Rowing Club</span>.&nbsp;
We take a pride in our rowing, we citizens of Chester,&mdash;and
not without reason, for in 1855, our &ldquo;crack crew&rdquo;
were twice victors at the Henley Regatta, and then and there
acknowledged &ldquo;Champions of the Isis and the
Thames!&rdquo;&nbsp; Whew! there go the
&ldquo;Royals&rdquo;&mdash;the champion crew, old Chester&rsquo;s
pride!&mdash;at a spanking pace, which nought but sterling metal
could possibly maintain!&nbsp; They are out for their daily
exercise, under the care of their trainer; the smile on whose
face betokens the delight with which he views their
performance.&nbsp; They are bad ones to beat, are those amateurs
of Chester!</p>
<p>Here is <i>Billy Hobby&rsquo;s Field</i>, with its Well of
pure water, bearing the same obscure but euphonious name.&nbsp;
The meadows on our right were anciently known as the
<i>Earl&rsquo;s Eye</i>, and used to be covered with water at
every tide.&nbsp; A few more strokes of the oar, and we are
scudding it past a second grove of trees, overshadowing the river
for a considerable distance.&nbsp; The <span
class="smcap">Dee</span> here forms a magnificent crescent, its
left bank studded with handsome villas,&mdash;foremost among
which, &ldquo;embosomed in foliage,&rdquo; stands <span
class="smcap">Dee Hills</span>, the residence of Mr.
Titherington; while, farther on, we see the new and elegant range
of villas, recently erected by that gentleman, called <span
class="smcap">Sandowne Terrace</span>.&nbsp; To these succeed
Richmond Villas, and Barrelwell, the sloping gardens of which
form a pleasing object in the landscape.</p>
<p>We are now speeding along in front of the <span
class="smcap">Water Works</span>, an establishment which has
literally worn itself out in &ldquo;the temperance cause,&rdquo;
and now, in a great measure, superseded by the New Works lately
erected in higher Boughton.&nbsp; Just above is <span
class="smcap">St. Paul&rsquo;s Church</span>, of which we told
you enough in our last chapter.</p>
<p>Onward again, past West Mount and Dee Banks, we are soon in
front of another range of villas, of recent construction, called
<a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span><span
class="smcap">Dee View</span>, from the long stretch of the Dee
which the site commands.&nbsp; This part of the River takes the
name of the <i>Long Reach</i>, until we come to <span
class="smcap">Iron Bridge</span>, vulgarly <i>Heron
Bridge</i>,&mdash;yonder house amid the trees&mdash;the pleasant
residence of C. W. Potts, Esq.</p>
<p>Yonder is the tower of <span class="smcap">Eccleston
Church</span>; and as we are now nearing the village, we may
land, if we choose, and indulge in a hasty stroll of
inspection.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Eccleston</span> is the pet
village, and wholly the property of the Marquis of Westminster,
whose elegant mansion, <span class="smcap">Eaton Hall</span>, we
are so soon about to visit.&nbsp; Every house in this village is
a picture of itself, clothed in woodbine and choicest evergreen,
and adorned with small, but sweetly smelling gardens.&nbsp; The
<span class="smcap">Church</span> is a modern structure of red
sandstone, having taken the place of an older temple in
1810.&nbsp; The interior has recently been altered and
re-decorated by Lord Westminster, and is now a pretty little
model of a village sanctuary.&nbsp; The space above the altar is
occupied by Westall&rsquo;s grand painting, &ldquo;Joseph of
Arimathea begging the Body of Jesus from Pilate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is now time to retrace our steps, and row glibly on towards
the <span class="smcap">Iron Bridge</span> and <span
class="smcap">Lodge</span>, the former erected, in 1824, by the
late Lord Westminster, at a cost of 8000<i>l.</i>&nbsp; Another
course, and one we ourselves prefer, is to row merely to the
<span class="smcap">Eaton Lodge</span>, a short distance up the
river, and there, leaving our friendly barge, take the road along
the Park,</p>
<blockquote><p>&rsquo;Twixt avenues of proud ancestral trees,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>till we find ourselves suddenly close to the western entrance
to <span class="smcap">Eaton Hall</span>, the princely seat of
the <span class="smcap">Marquis</span> or <span
class="smcap">Westminster</span>.</p>
<p>It is no part of our present business to assume the
herald&rsquo;s place, by painting the genealogy of the noble
house of <span class="smcap">Grosvenor</span>; else might we show
that the family trace back, in the direct male line, to the
Norman Conquest,&mdash;how that Gilbert le <i>Grosveneur</i> (or
the <i>Great Hunter</i>), nephew of Hugh Lupus, first Norman Earl
of Chester, came over with his uncle in the train of King
William,&mdash;that Robert le Grosvenor, a &ldquo;red-cross
knight,&rdquo; fought with much distinction under Richard I. in
the great Crusade,&mdash;how that another Robert covered himself
with honour at the battle of Cresy,&mdash;that his grandson
Robert was defendant in the famous &ldquo;Scroope and Grosvenor
suit,&rdquo; concerning the ancient arms of those two great
families.&nbsp; All this we could show,&mdash;and that later
still, in the Great Rebellion, when other magnates joined the
traitorous band, the &ldquo;House of Eaton&rdquo; remained
steadfast in its <a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>loyalty, and, in the person of Sir Richard Grosvenor
and his son Roger, raised the <i>posse comitatus</i> of Cheshire,
and gallantly therewith did battle for the King.&nbsp; But we
must forbear,&mdash;for see, we are now approaching the entrance
porch at the West Front of the <span
class="smcap">Hall</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Eaton</span> estate passed to the
<span class="smcap">Grosvenors</span> in the fifteenth century,
by the marriage of Raufe le Grosvenor with Joan, daughter of John
de Eaton; previously to which, for two centuries, the family had
been settled at Hulme, near Northwich.</p>
<p>A mansion of considerable importance existed here long prior
to the seventeenth century, being then usually known as <span
class="smcap">Eaton Boat</span>, from its proximity to the
ancient ferry of that name, across the river Dee.&nbsp; Sir
Thomas Grosvenor, however, son and grandson of the two ardent
royalists already mentioned, took unto himself a wife, in the
person of Mary Davies, of Ebury, county Middlesex; through whom
he acquired her father&rsquo;s valuable estates in
Westminster.&nbsp; The lady, it would seem, admired not the
humble palace at <span class="smcap">Eaton Boat</span>; for Sir
Thomas soon after erected in its stead a nobler mansion, from
designs furnished by Sir John Vanbrugh, the celebrated architect
and dramatist, who is confidently affirmed to have been a native
of Chester.&nbsp; This Hall, which was of brick, with a heavy
lanthorn roof, was pulled down, in 1803, by the late Lord
Westminster, who at once set to work with the magnificent fabric
we see now before us.&nbsp; It is built of white freestone from
the Manley quarry; Porden being the architect originally
consulted.&nbsp; Nine tedious years and a mint of money were
exhausted in its erection; and in 1823&ndash;5, two new wings
were added, so as almost to double its original length.&nbsp;
Critics now began to complain that its height was wholly
dis-proportioned to its length, and impertinent scribes picked
all manner of holes even in the architecture itself.</p>
<p>These and other considerations moved the present worthy
Marquis, in 1845, to attempt the remedying of these
defects.&nbsp; With his accustomed sagacity, he called in the
professional aid of Mr. Burn, an eminent London architect, to
whose ability and judgment his lordship confidently entrusted the
work.&nbsp; How that gentleman fulfilled his mission it skills
not for us to declare,&mdash;let the edifice before us speak for
itself.&nbsp; Erected and adorned regardless of expense, tasteful
and grand in design and execution, this princely pile, Gothic in
every material characteristic, is a model of all that is rich and
elegant in domestic architecture.&nbsp; Look up for a moment at
the gracefully light yet massive structure,&mdash;<a
name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>at its
sculptured niches, its crocketted pinnacles and embattled
parapets, its windows filled with gorgeous tracery, every
available space upon its surface bristling with shields charged
with the heraldic crests and quarterings of the Grosvenor
family,&mdash;and say if the sight, rich even to profusion, and
wholly indescribable, savours not more of a palace of fairy land
than of the house and home of a retiring English nobleman!&nbsp;
The <span class="smcap">Hall</span> itself exceeds four hundred
and fifty feet in length; but in addition to that we have the
Stables and outbuildings continuing the line, in the same Gothic
style, their centre crowned with a lofty Clock Turret of chaste
design.&nbsp; The entire length of the Hall and offices is nearly
seven hundred feet.&nbsp; But we must not any longer linger here,
for it is high time we were turning our attention to the interior
of the <span class="smcap">Hall</span>.</p>
<p>Mounting the flight of steps under the porch,&mdash;from the
top of which, through that dark vista of trees just a mile in
length, we see the <span class="smcap">Belgrave
Lodge</span>,&mdash;we present our tickets of admission to the
attendants, and are forthwith ushered into the <span
class="smcap">Entrance Hall</span> of certainly the most
magnificent mansion in Britain.&nbsp; This is an apartment
eminently calculated to prepare the visitor for the gorgeous
splendour everywhere pervading this far-famed Hall.&nbsp; In
height it extends to two stories of the house, the floor being
composed of the most richly varied tesselated marbles of the
utmost rarity.&nbsp; Imagine a floor, less than forty feet
square, costing its noble owner sixteen hundred guineas!&nbsp;
Glance up at the chaste and elegant groined ceiling, the
intersections relieved with foliated bosses and heraldic
devices,&mdash;foremost among the latter being the arms of the
Grosvenors, &ldquo;azure, a garb or,&rdquo; confirmed to the
family after their bootless legal suit with the Scroopes.&nbsp;
From the centre of the ceiling depends a gorgeous brass
chandelier lamp, of exquisite workmanship.&nbsp; Opposite the
entrance runs a Gothic screen of most elaborate character,
supporting and half hiding an open gallery, which leads from the
upper apartments on the north to those on the south side of the
Hall.&nbsp; This screen is furthermore decorated with fourteen
heraldic coats, in high relief, representing some of the numerous
quarterings of the Grosvenor family.&nbsp; On the right and left
are two chaste and beautiful white marble chimney-pieces,
corresponding in design with the rest of the apartment.&nbsp;
Above these, and on either side, are rich canopied niches, eight
in number, in which are placed stalwart figures of warriors, clad
in belted mail, and other ancient armour.&nbsp; In the lower
recesses of the screen are two <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>massive vases and pedestals of
Peterhead marble.&nbsp; Four marble statues give a finishing
grace to this noble <span class="smcap">Entrance
Hall</span>,&mdash;that on the right representing
&ldquo;Telemachus Arming,&rdquo; by Bienaim&eacute;; opposite to
it, on the left, being Rinaldi&rsquo;s classic group,
&ldquo;Ulysses Recognised by his Dog.&rdquo;&nbsp; The other two
present to us Gibson&rsquo;s conception of &ldquo;The Wounded
Amazon,&rdquo; and the equally meritorious &ldquo;Dying
Amazon,&rdquo; by Wolff.</p>
<p>From the <span class="smcap">Entrance Hall</span> we pass
through the Gothic arch upon the left, along the <span
class="smcap">Great Corridor</span>,&mdash;a handsome gallery,
near five hundred feet in length, enriched with numerous
portraits of the Grosvenor family, as well as a recumbent statue,
in marble, of a <i>Sleeping Bacchante</i>,&mdash;to the private
or <span class="smcap">Domestic Chapel</span> of the
mansion.&nbsp; This is reached by a short gallery to the left,
the two gothic windows of which are adorned with medallions of
<i>The Resurrection</i> and the <i>Madonna</i>, in richly stained
glass.&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Chapel</span>, which
measures about 40 &times; 30 feet, has a handsome groined roof,
tastefully relieved with floriated bosses and circular finials,
adorned with sacred monograms and other devices.&nbsp; The light
of day shines into the Chapel through three rich pointed windows,
upon the west side, each filled with stained glass of pristine
beauty.&nbsp; In the centres of these we see eighteen
vesica-shaped medallions, depicting scenes and events in the life
of Our Blessed Lord, viz., in the left-hand
window,&mdash;&ldquo;The Annunciation,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Virgin
and Child,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Wise Men of the East,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Shepherds Watching,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Presentation in
the Temple,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Flight into Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In the right-hand window we have&mdash;&ldquo;Christ giving Sight
to the Blind,&rdquo; &ldquo;Blessing Little Children,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Raising the Dead Lazarus,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Woman of
Samaria,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Baptism of Christ,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Christ Walking on the Sea.&rdquo;&nbsp; The subjects in
the centre window are&mdash;&ldquo;The Last Supper,&rdquo;
&ldquo;The Agony in the Garden,&rdquo; &ldquo;Christ bearing His
Cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Angel declaring the Resurrection,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Christ appearing to Mary,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Ascension.&rdquo;&nbsp; Contrary to usual ecclesiastical rule,
the reading-desk and communion-table, of carved oak, are at the
south end of the Chapel.&nbsp; Near by is the stall of the noble
Marquis, which, together with the rest of the seats, is of oak,
appropriately carved, under the superintendence of Mr. Morison,
then clerk of the works, but now permanently employed by Lord
Westminster in a higher capacity.&nbsp; On the north wall
formerly hung the painting now decorating the east side,
representing &ldquo;St. Michael&rsquo;s Contest with the
Dragon,&rdquo; a copy by Evans from the original by Guido.&nbsp;
A handsome window has recently been introduced into <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>the north
wall, and filled with embossed fleur-de-lys quarries of
plate-glass, producing an admirable effect.&nbsp; Over the
communion-table we perceive Weiser&rsquo;s spirited copy of
Rubens&rsquo; &ldquo;Descent from the Cross.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
servants&rsquo; entrance is by another door upon the left,
leading away to their apartments on the basement story.</p>
<p>Leaving the Chapel by the door at which we entered, we repass
through the lobby, observing in our course the fine bust of Our
Saviour, in marble, upon our right-hand.&nbsp; Thence crossing
the Great Corridor, we move along, through a short passage, into
the <span class="smcap">Dining-Room</span>.&nbsp; This is a
splendid apartment, chastely beautiful in all its details, and
though less profusely gorgeous than some of its companions, is
yet sufficiently so to justify its position as the great
Banqueting Room of the mansion.&nbsp; The ceiling is a
combination of rich and delicate tracery, dotted here and there
with the coats armorial of the family, and radiating almost
imperceptibly towards the centre, whence depends, from its
elaborate boss, a massive chandelier.&nbsp; Three richly-carved
mahogany sideboards, and a splendid mirror in five Gothic panels,
add a grace to this room, the walls of which are caparisoned in
maroon and gold on a white ground.&nbsp; Each corner of the room
has a chaste canopied niche, adorned with statuary from the
studio of Sir R. Westmacott,&mdash;those at the north end
representing the Crusader, &ldquo;Sir Robert le Grosvenor,&rdquo;
in mail armour, and &ldquo;Mary, Lady Grosvenor,&rdquo; the
heiress of Westminster.&nbsp; At the south end we have &ldquo;Sir
Gilbert le Grosvenor,&rdquo; the Norman patriarch of the family,
and &ldquo;Joan de Eaton,&rdquo; afterwards Lady Grosvenor, a
chaste and graceful conception of the sculptor.&nbsp; Over the
rich marble fireplace is an original
<i>chef-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvre</i>, of Rubens&mdash;&ldquo;The
Meeting of David and Abigail,&rdquo;&mdash;on either side of
which are full-length portraits of the first Marquis and
Marchioness of Westminster, painted by Jackson.</p>
<p>From this Room we pass through a handsome doorway into the
<span class="smcap">Ante-Dining-Room</span>, a smaller and much
plainer apartment, the walls painted a beautiful arabesque of
white and gold on a green ground, producing an extremely rich and
pleasing effect.&nbsp; The inlaid oak-floor, the delicate
ceiling, and the stained glass portraits of three of the Norman
Earls of Chester, which ornament the windows, all merit our
attention; but we must hurry away, and by a doorway opposite,
pass into the <span class="smcap">Saloon</span>.</p>
<p>This apartment is stated, and with every good reason, to be
without exception the most elegant room in Great Britain!&nbsp;
Let other scribes presume, if they will, to attempt a description
of this sumptuous hall of state,&mdash;<i>we</i>, for our part,
shrink dismayed from <a name="page127"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 127</span>the task.&nbsp; To do anything like
justice to its manifold merits would require far more time, and
infinitely greater powers, than <i>we</i> have at command; let us
be content, then, shortly and without parade, to point out a few
of its prevailing features.&nbsp; Measuring nearly eleven yards
square, the graceful arches intersecting the angles invest it
with quite an octagonal appearance.&nbsp; From these, and the
walls, springs the roof, with its majestic dome of dazzling
splendour&mdash;a matchless epitome of all that is rich, chaste,
and beautiful in decorative art.&nbsp; The prevailing colours are
crimson, blue, and gold, and these so judiciously blended that
the eye never tires in its fascinating mission; but still gazing
upwards, allured and bewildered, finds new beauties and richer
charms, the longer one remains in this wondrous <span
class="smcap">Saloon</span>.&nbsp; From the marble base springs a
lofty fretwork of painted mosaic, in close imitation of the
Ambassador&rsquo;s Court in the Alhambra Palace,&mdash;that
peerless relic of old Moorish magnificence.&nbsp; Higher still
range panels and medallions, apparently in high relief; but this
curious effect is a mere illusion of the painter, for the whole
of the walls are perfectly flat.&nbsp; Five handsome landscapes,
also painted on the walls, adorn this Saloon, four being the work
of Mr. Telbin, of London,&mdash;and the fifth the production of
Mr. John Morris, of Chester, to whose talented management the
entire decorative arrangements were confided.&nbsp; The imitation
basso-relievos over the doors are the work of a humble but
talented artist, the late William Tasker, of Chester.&nbsp; The
windows of the Saloon are in perfect consonance with the
apartment itself, and contain six handsome figures, representing
&ldquo;William the Conqueror&rdquo; and his uncle &ldquo;Odo,
Bishop of Bayeux;&rdquo; &ldquo;Sir Gilbert le Grosvenor,&rdquo;
nephew of King William, and an imaginary portrait of his wife;
&ldquo;Sir Robert le Grosvenor&rdquo; (of Scroope and Grosvenor
notoriety); and &ldquo;Joan Pulford,&rdquo; his wife.&nbsp; The
view from these windows, which open out to the <span
class="smcap">Terrace</span> and cloistered arcade on the East
side of the Hall, is one of rich and varied beauty.&nbsp; In the
foreground we see the elegant <span class="smcap">Terrace</span>,
<span class="smcap">Gardens</span>, and <span
class="smcap">Lake</span>; and just beyond, catch here and there
a glimpse of the &ldquo;tortuous Dee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Between yon
avenue of trees, and some sixteen miles away, the landscape ends
with the towering, rain-clad hill of Beeston, and the noble
baronial Castle of Peckforton.&nbsp; Our woodcut illustration of
the <span class="smcap">Hall</span> is taken from near the
Terrace beneath us, which is perhaps the best point for viewing
to perfection this side of the mansion.&nbsp; Turning again to
the Saloon, our eyes rest on the massive and elegant folding door
of carved oak, which, thrown open, reveals to us the great <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span><span
class="smcap">Entrance Hall</span>.&nbsp; These two apartments,
thus seen at one view, for gorgeous magnificence, stand alone and
unrivalled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p128b.jpg">
<img alt=
"Eaton Hall, East Front"
title=
"Eaton Hall, East Front"
 src="images/p128s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>We now pass on, by the south door of the Saloon, into the
<span class="smcap">Ante-Drawing-Room</span>, differing
materially in its enrichment from the room we have just quitted,
but withal an apartment of chastened beauty.&nbsp; It has a flat
ceiling, adorned with delicate tracery in cream-colour and gold;
the walls painted a rich arabesque, enchased throughout with red
and green on a cream-coloured ground.&nbsp; Three bookcases,
filled with modern &lsquo;light reading&rsquo; in elegant
bindings, add a grace to the apartment,&mdash;the fine windows of
which contain stained glass figures of Hugh Cyvelioc, Randle
Blondeville, and John Scot, the last of the line of Norman Earls
of Chester.</p>
<p>Next we have the <span class="smcap">Drawing-Room</span>,
second only to the Saloon in the splendour of its
decorations.&nbsp; Fifty feet in length&mdash;its ceiling
sparkling with heraldic shields, and honeycombed with tracery in
cream-colour and gold&mdash;its walls hung with rich <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>crimson
silk damask; its superb niches, vases, and chandelier; its marble
chimney-piece and mirror; its glorious original pictures of the
&ldquo;Wise Men&rsquo;s Offering,&rdquo; by Rubens, the
&ldquo;Battles of the Boyne and La Hogue,&rdquo; by West, and
other celebrated works of art,&mdash;all invest this room with a
halo which no words of ours can possibly do justice to.&nbsp; It
must be seen to be appreciated; and to be admired as it deserves,
must be closely scrutinised in all its bearings.</p>
<p>From the Drawing-Room we proceed, along the corridor, into the
<span class="smcap">Library</span>, a spacious apartment at the
southern extremity of the <span class="smcap">Hall</span>.&nbsp;
This well-proportioned room measures sixty-two feet by fifty
feet; a range of pillars on either side adding symmetry and
strength to its richly groined ceiling.&nbsp; Three bold Gothic
windows, facing south, east, and west, shed a fine flood of light
into the room; the oaken bookcases of which are filled to
overflowing with the richest and rarest works of ancient and
modern literature.&nbsp; Upon the left we observe a fine organ,
in a carved mahogany case.&nbsp; But the most attractive objects,
apart from the library itself, are the remarkably chaste and
beautiful conceptions in marble of &ldquo;Cephalus and
Procris,&rdquo; by Rinaldi, which occupies the centre, and the
quite as enchanting <i>chefs-d&rsquo;&oelig;uvres</i> of
Wyatt&mdash;&ldquo;Glycera&rdquo; and &ldquo;Hebe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In this room also is preserved one of those extremely rare
Romano-British ornaments, a golden <span
class="smcap">Torque</span>, discovered some years ago near
Caerwys, in Flintshire.&nbsp; The Torque was an ornament worn
round the necks of illustrious British warriors: Queen Boadicea,
and Llewellyn, Lord of Yale, are both recorded to have been so
decorated.&nbsp; Who was the original owner of the one now before
us is a matter, of course, wrapped in impenetrable obscurity.</p>
<p>But time presses, and we, too, must press on.&nbsp; Passing
out from the Library, we may now direct our steps to the <span
class="smcap">State Bedroom</span>.&nbsp; This is a plain, yet
elegant, apartment,&mdash;its prime feature being the mahogany
State Bed, most elaborately carved, whereon have reposed the
sleeping majesty of England, and other royal and distinguished
personages.&nbsp; The handsome mirror, the rich green Brussels
carpet, and other furniture of the chamber, are all in chaste and
admirable keeping with the principal Bedroom of this
&ldquo;Palace on the Dee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turn we now to the <span class="smcap">Grand Staircase</span>,
a portion of the Hall which may vie with any we have yet visited,
whether for beauty or variety.&nbsp; A flight of stairs running
up from the centre, continued again towards the right and left,
conduct to the second gallery, and to the private apartments on
the higher story.&nbsp; <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>Opposite to us, on either side as we
ascend, are two Egyptian statues in coloured marble, within rich
Gothic niches.&nbsp; The decorations of this staircase are
sumptuous in the extreme, blue and gold being the predominant
colours,&mdash;the whole producing to the eye of taste a grand,
impressive, and lasting effect.&nbsp; Among the paintings
embellishing this staircase and its vicinity are the
&ldquo;Leicestershire Hunt,&rdquo; by Ferneley, the
&ldquo;Grosvenor Hunt,&rdquo; by Stubbs, and another of the
&ldquo;Cheshire Hunt,&rdquo; all three introducing portraits of
the Grosvenor family, either of the last or present
generation.&nbsp; Another picture deserving our notice is that of
a &ldquo;Brood Mare and Foals,&rdquo; painted also by
Stubbs.&nbsp; The private Sitting-Rooms of Lord and Lady
Westminster, which with other apartments adjoin the <span
class="smcap">Great Corridor</span>, are not exhibited to
strangers.&nbsp; Numerous pieces of statuary, family portraits,
and racing pictures, many of them of great interest, arrest our
attention as we move along the Corridor; but having now returned
to the <span class="smcap">Entrance Hall</span>, we must beat a
hasty retreat from this scene of enchantment, and, emerging from
its portals, bid &ldquo;a last, a long farewell&rdquo; to <span
class="smcap">Eaton Hall</span>, the palatial home of the Marquis
of Westminster.</p>
<p>Before we do so, however, if provided beforehand with tickets
from &ldquo;our publisher,&rdquo; we may take a turn round the
spacious <span class="smcap">Gardens</span> on the east side of
the Hall.&nbsp; Though time and space alike forbid us to enlarge
upon their charms, the <span class="smcap">Gardens</span> of
<span class="smcap">Eaton</span> will amply repay the careful
inspection of every admirer of &ldquo;nature,
art-adorned.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rich groves of trees&mdash;the rare
shrubs and flowers, with their attendant perfumes&mdash;the
crystal conservatory&mdash;the massive statuary&mdash;the dolphin
fountain&mdash;the Roman altar, dedicated by the Twentieth Legion
to the &ldquo;Nymphs and Fountains&rdquo;&mdash;the fairy
lake&mdash;the verdant lawns, and walks of &ldquo;sweet
umbrageous beauty,&rdquo;&mdash;each and all combine to invest
these <span class="smcap">Gardens</span> with a charm peculiarly
their own!&nbsp; Gladly would we linger all day in this sylvan
retreat,&mdash;but we must away!&mdash;and exchanging our barge
for a cab with a party just arrived (cabman and boatmen first of
all consenting), we are soon out of sight of the &ldquo;Palace on
the <span class="smcap">Dee</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving rapidly along the avenue, past yon herd of timid deer,
startled into flight at our approach, we soon flit beneath the
archway of a lodge which marks the boundary of the park.&nbsp; A
ride of two miles, through a serpentine avenue of &ldquo;old
hereditary trees,&rdquo; now remains to us; and from this we
emerge only to behold the <span class="smcap">Grosvenor
Gateway</span>, with old <span class="smcap">Chester</span> in
the distance &ldquo;lending <a name="page131"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 131</span>enchantment to the
view!&rdquo;&nbsp; The <span class="smcap">Grosvenor
Gateway</span> was erected in 1838, on the site of Overleigh
Hall, once the manorial seat of the Cowpers of Overleigh.&nbsp;
This lodge is a copy of St. Augustine&rsquo;s Gate, at
Canterbury, altered (some say improved) here and there by Mr.
Jones, architect of Chester.&nbsp; Built, like the Hall itself,
of white freestone, enriched with a profuseness of carving and
heraldic sculpture, this <span class="smcap">Entrance
Lodge</span> to the <span class="smcap">Eaton</span> Estate forms
a fitting introduction to the magnificent mansion we have just
quitted, and of which, in conclusion, we may truly enough say
that</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take
it for all in all,<br />
We ne&rsquo;er shall look upon its like again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In five minutes more our cab is rolling over the well-paved
streets of <span class="smcap">Chester</span>.&nbsp; And now, as
you are off by the next train, and as the best of friends must
part, we will shake you by the hand, and trusting you have
enjoyed yourselves under our protection, wish you, with all our
heart, a swift and pleasant journey to your <span
class="smcap">Home</span>, <span class="smcap">Sweet
Home</span>!</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>In closing this account of <span class="smcap">Eaton
Hall</span>, it is our pleasing duty gratefully to acknowledge
Lord Westminster&rsquo;s kindness and favour, not only in
throwing open the mansion and grounds to us on a &ldquo;private
day,&rdquo; but also in affording us every possible assistance in
our humble endeavours, however feebly, to do justice to his
peerless Cheshire home.</p>
<p>To G. Allen, Esq., his Lordship&rsquo;s house steward, as well
as to Mr. J. Morison, we are especially beholden,&mdash;to the
former, for his courteous attention in pointing out every
prominent feature of the Hall&mdash;and to the latter, for
numerous architectural and other data, of essential service to us
in our &ldquo;labour of love.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Visitors</span> are reminded that <span
class="smcap">Eaton Hall and Grounds</span> are, by the kindness
of Lord Westminster, exhibited to the public during the months of
<span class="smcap">June</span>, <span class="smcap">July</span>,
and <span class="smcap">August</span>, subject to the following
judicious regulations:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays, between the
hours of ten and four, to Residents and Tourists generally; and
on Thursdays also, during the same hours, to <i>Foreigners
only</i>, or <i>Travellers from a distance</i>.&nbsp; In order to
do away with the unsatisfactory principle of giving fees to the
servants, his Lordship has authorised the sale of <span
class="smcap">Admission Tickets</span>, in accordance with the
following tariff.&nbsp; The money realised by the sale of these
Tickets is generously appropriated by Lord Westminster to the
benefit of the funds of the various <span class="smcap">Chester
Charities</span>.</p>

<p>Persons effecting Assurances with the <span
class="smcap">Alliance Company</span>, enjoy the following
important Advantages:&mdash;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Perfect
Security</span>.&mdash;The large invested Capital, and the
personal responsibility, of upwards of One Thousand Shareholders,
render the security undoubted.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Moderate Premiums of
Assurance</span>.&mdash;The Rates for Life Assurance will be
found generally reasonable; and, for the younger Ages, lower than
those in use in many of the older and most respectable
Offices.</p>
<p>The Premiums for Assurance on <span class="smcap">Fire</span>
are the same as those which are demanded by the first class of
Assurance Companies.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Participation of Profits by the
Assured</span>, <span class="smcap">both in Life and
Fire</span>.&mdash;The Profits, appropriated to the participating
Assured, are applied, every Five Years, to the increase of the
amounts assured, or to the reduction of the future Premiums,
according to the choice of the Assured.</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Profits</span> of the <span
class="smcap">Fire</span> Department appropriated to the Assured,
are distributed at the close of each successive period of Five
years, in the form of a per-centage on the Premiums which have
been paid.</p>
<p>IV.&nbsp; Parties who obtain the settlement of Losses from
Fire are not thereby deprived of their right to participate in
the Profits of the Company.</p>
<p>V.&nbsp; Losses by Lightning are made good.</p>
<p>VI.&nbsp; The Company are liable for losses by <span
class="smcap">Explosion</span>, unless such explosion should be
occasioned by gunpowder deposited on the premises, or except in
cases specially provided for in the Policy.</p>
<p>The Directors grant Loans on the sole security of the
Company&rsquo;s Policies, if unencumbered, to nearly the full
extent of their value, provided such value will justify an
advance of not less than &pound;50.</p>
<p>The Cost of the Stamps upon Life Policies is borne by the
Company.</p>
<p>Life Committees are held at the Office every Wednesday and
Friday at one o&rsquo;clock; but to facilitate transactions,
appearances can be taken, when requisite, on any other day.</p>

<p>The Justice and Liberality of its Principles, and their

large and rapidly increasing business; and it may fairly be
considered one of the most flourishing and successful
institutions of modern date.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><span class="GutSmall">PERSONS
ASSURED IN THIS OFFICE HAVE THE FOLLOWING PRIVILEGES:</span></p>
<p>Every Member has a right to vote in the Election of Directors

<p>Annual publication of Accounts, which are audited by Public
Accountants, who are in no way interested in the Society.</p>
<p>No advantage is taken of a Member&rsquo;s temporary inability
to pay the Premium, as the Society will, on application, advance
the required amount as often as the value of the Policy will
admit.</p>
<p>No charge made for Policy Stamp, Entrance Money, or Medical
Fees, nor is any other payment required beyond the Premium.</p>
<p>Should a Member fall into difficulties, or be otherwise
totally unable to continue his payments, he would not, as in
other Offices, lose all he had paid in, but would have a fresh
Policy granted to him, <span class="smcap">Free from ant further

<p>I.&nbsp; Instead of making a small return to the Insurers at

as the renewal Premiums become due, virtually making a large
reduction from future Payments.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">No charge</span> for <span

<p>V.&nbsp; <span class="smcap">Claims Settled</span> with
Promptness and Liberality.</p>
<p>The MUTUAL PRINCIPLE, with freedom from liability to the
Insured, as applied to Fire Insurance, is a novel system, based
on liberal and equitable arrangements, thereby securing to the
Insured a participation in the Profits they themselves have
created; hence, in proportion to the amount of business
introduced to this Office by the Insured, so are their own Rates
of Premium reduced, or their own Profits increased.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at

Gutenberg-tm electronic works

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
